# Experimental Data

This directory contains all the data generated by and used for the experimental analysis of the MCPybarra framework. It is divided into two main subdirectories.

## Subdirectories

### ðŸ“‚ `raw_run_data/`

- **Content:** Contains the raw, unprocessed output from every individual experimental run.
- **Structure:** Each subdirectory within `raw_run_data/`, named with a timestamp (e.g., `run_20250713_004043/`), represents a single, complete execution of the benchmark or analysis pipeline. These folders contain the original log files, detailed test reports (`.md`), and raw score files (`.csv`) generated during that specific run.
- **Purpose:** Serves as the primary source of truth for all analyses. Data here is intended for aggregation and processing by the scripts in the `scripts/` directory, not for direct interpretation.

### ðŸ“‚ `summary_data/`

- **Content:** Contains cleaned, processed, and aggregated data, primarily in `.csv` and occasionally `.md` format (when used as a data source).
- **Structure:** This directory is a flat collection of summary files. Each file represents a consolidated view of data from one or more runs in `raw_run_data/`. For example, `raw_scores_collection.csv` contains the combined scores from all relevant experiments.
- **Purpose:** These files serve as the direct, machine-readable inputs for the analysis and visualization scripts located in the `scripts/` directory. They represent the "cleaned" dataset from which the final paper results are derived.
