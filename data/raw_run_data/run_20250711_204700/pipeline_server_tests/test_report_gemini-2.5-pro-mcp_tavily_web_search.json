It's long been common practice to use the `alert()` function for this purpose because it's short, harmless, and pretty hard to miss when it's successfully called. In fact, you solve the majority of our XSS labs by invoking `alert()` in a simulated victim's browser. [...] Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If [...] Unfortunately, there's a slight hitch if you use Chrome. From version 92 onward (July 20th, 2021), cross-origin iframes are prevented from calling `alert()`. As these are used to construct some of the more advanced XSS attacks, you'll sometimes need to use an alternative PoC payload. In this scenario, we recommend the `print()` function.
