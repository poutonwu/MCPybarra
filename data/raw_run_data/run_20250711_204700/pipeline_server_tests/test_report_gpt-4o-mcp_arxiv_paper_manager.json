This\\npaper elaborates on the concepts of secure design and how our approach enhances\\nthe training of the future cybersecurity workforce.\", \"published\": \"2018-06-04\", \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01198v1\"}, {\"id\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10874v1\", \"title\": \"Building a Resilient Cybersecurity Posture: A Framework for Leveraging Prevent, Detect and Respond Functions and Law Enforcement Collaboration\", \"authors\": [\"Francesco Schiliro\"], \"summary\": \"This research paper proposes a framework for building a resilient\\ncybersecurity posture that leverages prevent, detect, and respond functions and\\nlaw enforcement collaboration. The Cybersecurity Resilience and Law Enforcement\\nCollaboration (CyRLEC) Framework is designed to provide a comprehensive and\\nintegrated approach to cybersecurity that emphasizes collaboration with law\\nenforcement agencies to mitigate cyber threats. The paper compares and\\ncontrasts the CyRLEC Framework with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and\\nhighlights the critical differences between the two frameworks. While the NIST\\nframework focuses on managing cybersecurity risk, the CyRLEC Framework takes a\\nbroader view of cybersecurity, including proactive prevention, early detection,\\nrapid response to cyber-attacks, and close collaboration with law enforcement\\nagencies to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals. The paper also provides a\\ncase study of a simulated real-world implementation of the CyRLEC Framework and\\nevaluates its effectiveness in improving an organization's cybersecurity\\nposture. The research findings demonstrate the value of the CyRLEC Framework in\\nenhancing cybersecurity resilience and promoting effective collaboration with\\nlaw enforcement agencies. Overall, this research paper contributes to the\\ngrowing knowledge of cybersecurity frameworks and provides practical insights\\nfor organizations seeking to improve their cybersecurity posture.\", \"published\": \"2023-03-20\", \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10874v1\"}, {\"id\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05683v1\", \"title\": \"Cybersecurity Dynamics: A Foundation for the Science of Cybersecurity\", \"authors\": [\"Shouhuai Xu\"], \"summary\": \"Cybersecurity Dynamics is new concept that aims to achieve the modeling,\\nanalysis, quantification, and management of cybersecurity from a holistic\\nperspective, rather than from a building-blocks perspective.

In this Chapter, we systematically introduce and review the\\nCybersecurity Dynamics foundation for the Science of Cybersecurity.

A sample of 42 students was selected purposively without\\nprior knowledge of Cybersecurity and divided identically into experimental and\\ncontrol groups.

However, recalling LLM APIs\\ncan be expensive, and the response speed may\\nslow down during LLMs\\u2019 peak times, caus-\\ning frustration among developers. Potential\\nsolutions to this problem include using better\\nLLM models or investing in more computing re-\\nsources. However, these options may increase\\nproduct development costs and decrease devel-\\nopment speed. GPTCache2is an open-source\\nsemantic cache that stores LLM responses to\\naddress this issue. When integrating an AI ap-\\nplication with GPTCache, user queries are first\\nsent to GPTCache for a response before be-\\ning sent to LLMs like ChatGPT. If GPTCache\\nhas the answer to a question, it quickly returns\\nthe answer to the user without having to query\\nthe LLM. This approach saves costs on API\\nrecalls and makes response times much faster.\\nFor instance, integrating GPTCache with the\\nGPT service offered by OpenAI can increase\\nresponse speed 2-10 times when the cache is\\nhit. Moreover, network fluctuations will not\\naffect GPTCache\\u2019s response time, making it\\nhighly stable. This paper presents GPTCache\\nand its architecture, how it functions and per-\\nforms, and the use cases for which it is most\\nadvantageous.\\n1 Introduction\\nSince OpenAI released ChatGPT, large language\\nmodels have impressed many people and have been\\nfrequently integrated into our daily work and lives.\\nAt the same time, more open-source enthusiasts\\nand tech companies have invested time and effort\\ninto developing open-source LLMs, such as Meta\\u2019s\\nLLama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Google\\u2019s PaLM\\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022), Stanford\\u2019s Alpaca (Wang\\n1https://openai.com/chatgpt\\n2https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCacheet al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023), and Databrick\\u2019s\\nDolly (Conover et al., 2023).\\nThere are two ways to use large language mod-\\nels: online services provided by companies like\\nOpenAI, Claude, and Cohere or downloading open-\\nsource models and deploying them on your servers.\\nBoth methods require payment. Online services\\ncharge you based on tokens, while deploying mod-\\nels on your own server requires purchasing specific\\ncomputing resources. The choice depends on indi-\\nvidual needs.\\nWhile online services are more expensive, they\\nare more convenient and effective and provide a bet-\\nter user experience than deploying models yourself.\\nCosts and user experience are two critical consid-\\nerations for building LLM applications. As your\\nLLM application gains popularity and experiences\\na surge in traffic, the cost of LLM API calls will\\nincrease significantly. High response latency will\\nalso be frustrating, particularly during peak times\\nfor LLMs, directly affecting the user experience.\\nGPTCache is an open-source semantic cache\\ndesigned to improve the efficiency and speed of\\nGPT-based applications by storing and retrieving\\nthe responses generated by language models. Un-\\nlike traditional cache systems such as Redis, GPT-\\nCache employs semantic caching, which stores and\\nretrieves data through embeddings. It utilizes em-\\nbedding algorithms to transform the queries and\\nLLMs\\u2019 responses into embeddings and conducts\\nsimilarity searches on these embeddings using a\\nvector store such as Milvus. GPTCache allows\\nusers to customize the cache to their specific re-\\nquirements, offering a range of choices for embed-\\nding, similarity assessment, storage location, and\\neviction policies. Furthermore, GPTCache sup-\\nports both the OpenAI ChatGPT interface and the\\nLangchain interface, with plans to support more\\ninterfaces in the coming months.\\nThrough experiments using the\\nparaphrase-albert-small-v2 model (Reimers212\\nand Gurevych, 2019) to embed input in the onnx\\nruntime environment and running it on a local\\nMac with i7, 4CPU, and 32G memory, the time\\nconsumed when hitting the cache is approximately\\n0.3 seconds. Compared to accessing OpenAI\\nChatGPT with an average response latency of\\n3 seconds, the time consumed is only 1/10.\\nFurthermore, no tokens are consumed when\\nhitting the cache. Different embedding models\\nand similarity evaluation algorithms must be\\nselected in real development scenarios based on\\nthe tolerance for cache errors. Even so, the entire\\nconsumption time is about 3-4 times faster.\\n2 Related Works\\n2.1 Accelerating LLM Inference\\nAccelerating LLM Inference. Large language mod-\\nels (LLMs) typically take seconds to infer an-\\nswers, prompting researchers to explore ways to\\nreduce inference time and resource consumption.\\nOne approach is quantization (Dettmers and Zettle-\\nmoyer, 2023), which decreases the number of bits\\nneeded to represent each parameter and, therefore\\nreduces the model size. However, this can result\\nin a trade-off between accuracy and memory foot-\\nprint. Another method is pruning, which can spar-\\nsify large-scale generative pre-trained transformer\\n(GPT) models without retraining, as demonstrated\\nby SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023). Ad-\\nditional methods include Compressing (Xu et al.,\\n2020) and Inference with Reference (Yang et al.,\\n2023).\\n2.2 Widespread application of Caching\\nWidespread application of Caching. Caching is a\\ncommonly used technique to reduce frequent and\\ncomputationally expensive data accesses, which\\ncan improve system query performance.

However, recalling LLM APIs\\ncan be expensive, and the response speed may\\nslow down during LLMs\\u2019 peak times, caus-\\ning frustration among developers. Potential\\nsolutions to this problem include using better\\nLLM models or investing in more computing re-\\nsources. However, these options may increase\\nproduct development costs and decrease devel-\\nopment speed. GPTCache2is an open-source\\nsemantic cache that stores LLM responses to\\naddress this issue. When integrating an AI ap-\\nplication with GPTCache, user queries are first\\nsent to GPTCache for a response before be-\\ning sent to LLMs like ChatGPT. If GPTCache\\nhas the answer to a question, it quickly returns\\nthe answer to the user without having to query\\nthe LLM. This approach saves costs on API\\nrecalls and makes response times much faster.\\nFor instance, integrating GPTCache with the\\nGPT service offered by OpenAI can increase\\nresponse speed 2-10 times when the cache is\\nhit. Moreover, network fluctuations will not\\naffect GPTCache\\u2019s response time, making it\\nhighly stable. This paper presents GPTCache\\nand its architecture, how it functions and per-\\nforms, and the use cases for which it is most\\nadvantageous.\\n1 Introduction\\nSince OpenAI released ChatGPT, large language\\nmodels have impressed many people and have been\\nfrequently integrated into our daily work and lives.\\nAt the same time, more open-source enthusiasts\\nand tech companies have invested time and effort\\ninto developing open-source LLMs, such as Meta\\u2019s\\nLLama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Google\\u2019s PaLM\\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022), Stanford\\u2019s Alpaca (Wang\\n1https://openai.com/chatgpt\\n2https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCacheet al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023), and Databrick\\u2019s\\nDolly (Conover et al., 2023).\\nThere are two ways to use large language mod-\\nels: online services provided by companies like\\nOpenAI, Claude, and Cohere or downloading open-\\nsource models and deploying them on your servers.\\nBoth methods require payment. Online services\\ncharge you based on tokens, while deploying mod-\\nels on your own server requires purchasing specific\\ncomputing resources. The choice depends on indi-\\nvidual needs.\\nWhile online services are more expensive, they\\nare more convenient and effective and provide a bet-\\nter user experience than deploying models yourself.\\nCosts and user experience are two critical consid-\\nerations for building LLM applications. As your\\nLLM application gains popularity and experiences\\na surge in traffic, the cost of LLM API calls will\\nincrease significantly. High response latency will\\nalso be frustrating, particularly during peak times\\nfor LLMs, directly affecting the user experience.\\nGPTCache is an open-source semantic cache\\ndesigned to improve the efficiency and speed of\\nGPT-based applications by storing and retrieving\\nthe responses generated by language models. Un-\\nlike traditional cache systems such as Redis, GPT-\\nCache employs semantic caching, which stores and\\nretrieves data through embeddings. It utilizes em-\\nbedding algorithms to transform the queries and\\nLLMs\\u2019 responses into embeddings and conducts\\nsimilarity searches on these embeddings using a\\nvector store such as Milvus. GPTCache allows\\nusers to customize the cache to their specific re-\\nquirements, offering a range of choices for embed-\\nding, similarity assessment, storage location, and\\neviction policies. Furthermore, GPTCache sup-\\nports both the OpenAI ChatGPT interface and the\\nLangchain interface, with plans to support more\\ninterfaces in the coming months.\\nThrough experiments using the\\nparaphrase-albert-small-v2 model (Reimers212\\nand Gurevych, 2019) to embed input in the onnx\\nruntime environment and running it on a local\\nMac with i7, 4CPU, and 32G memory, the time\\nconsumed when hitting the cache is approximately\\n0.3 seconds. Compared to accessing OpenAI\\nChatGPT with an average response latency of\\n3 seconds, the time consumed is only 1/10.\\nFurthermore, no tokens are consumed when\\nhitting the cache. Different embedding models\\nand similarity evaluation algorithms must be\\nselected in real development scenarios based on\\nthe tolerance for cache errors. Even so, the entire\\nconsumption time is about 3-4 times faster.\\n2 Related Works\\n2.1 Accelerating LLM Inference\\nAccelerating LLM Inference. Large language mod-\\nels (LLMs) typically take seconds to infer an-\\nswers, prompting researchers to explore ways to\\nreduce inference time and resource consumption.\\nOne approach is quantization (Dettmers and Zettle-\\nmoyer, 2023), which decreases the number of bits\\nneeded to represent each parameter and, therefore\\nreduces the model size. However, this can result\\nin a trade-off between accuracy and memory foot-\\nprint. Another method is pruning, which can spar-\\nsify large-scale generative pre-trained transformer\\n(GPT) models without retraining, as demonstrated\\nby SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023). Ad-\\nditional methods include Compressing (Xu et al.,\\n2020) and Inference with Reference (Yang et al.,\\n2023).\\n2.2 Widespread application of Caching\\nWidespread application of Caching.
