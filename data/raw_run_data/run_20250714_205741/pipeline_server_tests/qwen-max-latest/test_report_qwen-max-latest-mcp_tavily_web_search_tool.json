Observational precipitation and streamflow variations were analyzed using long-term records from monitoring stations (e.g., rain and discharge gauges), complemented with information from satellite altimetry-derived river water level changes as well as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data. By integrating remote sensing, statistical hydrology, and projected implications of future climate, we provide evidence that extreme rainfall on saturated soils, along with accelerated upstream snowmelt driven by high temperatures and rain-on-snow, were major drivers of the cataclysmic flood event. **e** Bar chart showing the relative change in cumulative precipitation during the pre-monsoon (Jan–May) and monsoon (Jun–Sep) periods in 2022, compared to the long-term climatology (1951–2021) across eight meteorological stations in the flood-exposed region.\"\n}",
