This allows companies to transform processes that were previously only possible for humans to perform\\u2014think responding tocustomer service calls, bookkeeping, and reviewing resumes.\\n\\nImage 8: Two main techniques of Machine Learning\\nMachine learning uses two main techniques:\", \"score\": 0.92...[截断]，输出已被MCP适配器截断，这是适配器的限制而非工具本身的问题。共计3975字符，剩余2475字符"
