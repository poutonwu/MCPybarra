Define RESTful web API resource URIs To achieve loose coupling in a RESTful web API, use only standard protocols and implement a mechanism that allows the client and the web service to agree on the format of the data to exchange. For example, to receive information on a specific order, the client performs an HTTP GET request on the URI `https://api.contoso.com/orders/1` to receive the following JSON body as a resource representation of the internal order data: Instead of providing multiple URIs, you can specify the version of the resource by using a parameter within the query string appended to the HTTP request, such as `https://api.contoso.com/customers/3?\"\n}",

They rely on qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for more complex computations and parallel processing. Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave.
