# MCPybarra Experimental Results Directory

## Open Source Strategy

To protect research outcomes, we adopt a phased open-source approach:

### Currently Available

- ✅ Basic evaluation framework
- ✅ Complete pipeline run results (`run_20250713_004043/`)
- ✅ Experimental data structure examples
- ✅ Key experimental result charts and data summaries

### Available After Paper Acceptance

- 📊 Complete experimental data
- 🛠️ Complete evaluation scripts
