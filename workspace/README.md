# MCPybarra Workspace Directory

## Overview

This workspace contains the complete experimental results and all 25 generated MCP (Meta-Controller Program) servers from our research. All code and data are now fully open-sourced following the completion of our study.

## Generated Content

### Model-Generated Servers

This directory contains 25 distinct MCP servers generated by various large language models using our framework. Each model-specific subdirectory holds a complete set of these 25 servers.

- `gemini-2.5-pro/`
- `gpt-4o/`
- `deepseek-v3/`
- `qwen-max-latest/`
- `qwen-plus/`

### MetaGPT Results

This directory contains servers generated using the MetaGPT framework, which were used for comparative analysis in our research.

### Public MCP Servers

This directory includes 25 reference MCP server implementations from the open-source community, which served as a baseline for our experiments. They cover three main categories:

- **Data/Content Retrieval**: Academic search, ArXiv, DuckDuckGo, HuggingFace, Tavily, Financial data, Data exploration, Image search, Unsplash, Everything search, Flights
- **File/Format Processing**: PDF tools, Word automation, Markdown processing, Image conversion, Text editing, OpenCV, Screenshot automation
- **Application/System Integration**: MongoDB, MySQL, Git, SSH, Outlook, Zotero
