# mcp_outlook_manager

## Overview

The `mcp_outlook_manager` is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables large language models to interact with Microsoft Outlook via a set of tools. This server allows for listing folders, searching and retrieving emails, replying to messages, and composing new emails â€” all programmatically through the MCP interface.

This integration provides seamless access to Outlook data such as email folders, recent or filtered messages, and supports common operations like reading, replying, and sending emails.

## Installation

Before running the server, ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pywin32 mcp
```

These packages are also listed in a `requirements.txt` file if you prefer installing via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** This server uses `pywin32` to interface with Outlook and therefore only works on Windows systems where Outlook is installed and running.

## Running the Server

To start the MCP Outlook Manager server, run the Python script from the command line:

```bash
python mcp_outlook_server.py
```

This will launch the server using the default `stdio` transport protocol, allowing clients to communicate with it locally.
