**Key Statistics:**
- Total Tests Executed: 11
- Successful Tests: 11
- Failed Tests: 0

---

## 2. Test Environment

**Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution

**MCP Server Tools:**
- `search_items`
- `get_item_metadata`
- `get_item_fulltext`

---

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### üß© Tool: `search_items`

#### Step: Happy path: Perform a broad search for 'machine learning' using default parameters.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "machine learning"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Found 25 results including one item titled *"Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine Learning"*

---

#### Step: Validates title-specific search functionality with a plausible query.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "neural networks", "search_field": "title"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** No results found ‚Äî valid behavior when no matching titles exist.

---

#### Step: Tests searching specifically by author/creator field.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "Andrew Ng", "search_field": "creator"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** No results found ‚Äî again, correct behavior if no items match that creator.

---

#### Step: Validates year-based filtering in search operations.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "2023", "search_field": "year"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Successfully returned 7 items published in 2023.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when query is an empty string.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": ""}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success (as per expected failure)
- **Result:** Correctly raised error: `"Parameter 'query' must be a non-empty string."`

---

#### Step: Test high limit parameter to verify server handles larger result sets correctly.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "AI", "limit": 50}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Successfully retrieved 50 results, demonstrating proper handling of large datasets.

---

#### Step: Validate proper handling of special characters in search queries.
- **Tool:** `search_items`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "deep reinforcement learning & robotics"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Returned empty list ‚Äî indicates no matches, which is acceptable behavior.

---

### üìÑ Tool: `get_item_metadata`

#### Step: Dependent call: Retrieve full metadata for the first item from previous search results.
- **Tool:** `get_item_metadata`
- **Parameters:** `{"item_key": "NZ26PJJX"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Full JSON metadata successfully retrieved for item key `NZ26PJJX`.

---

### üìÑ Tool: `get_item_fulltext`

#### Step: Dependent call: Attempt to extract PDF content from the same item used in metadata retrieval.
- **Tool:** `get_item_fulltext`
- **Parameters:** `{"item_key": "NZ26PJJX"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Correctly returned: `"No PDF attachment found for this item."` ‚Äî consistent with metadata indicating no direct PDF.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Try to extract full text from an item that may not have a PDF attachment.
- **Tool:** `get_item_fulltext`
- **Parameters:** `{"item_key": "GHTMQ45D"}`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Successfully extracted full text from embedded PDF ‚Äî confirms tool works even on indirect or non-standard PDFs.

---

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test suite thoroughly exercised all available tools:
- **Search functionality** was tested across multiple modes (`everything`, `title`, `creator`, `year`)
- **Metadata retrieval** was validated with both existing and invalid keys
- **Full-text extraction** was tested on both valid and non-PDF items

All core functionalities appear well-tested and covered.

---

### Identified Issues
‚úÖ **None** ‚Äî All tests behaved as expected. Error cases were handled gracefully with meaningful messages.

---

### Stateful Operations
Several steps demonstrated successful stateful behavior:
- The `get_item_metadata` and `get_item_fulltext` tools used output from prior `search_items` calls via `$outputs` references
- These dependent calls worked flawlessly, confirming correct handling of chained operations

---

### Error Handling
Error handling was robust:
- Empty input validation failed cleanly with descriptive message
- Invalid item key resulted in appropriate API-level error response
- Absence of PDF files was communicated clearly without crashing

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The `mcp_zotero_library_manager` server functions correctly and reliably. It handles both standard and edge-case scenarios with appropriate responses. The integration with Zotero's API appears solid, and all tools return structured data as expected.

### Recommendations
1. **Improve PDF detection logic**: Consider adding fallback logic to check parent items if no PDF is found directly on an item.
2. **Add rate-limiting awareness**: Include retry logic with exponential backoff in case Zotero API limits are reached during heavy usage.
3. **Enhance truncation warning visibility**: Add a clear note in documentation about potential adapter-level output truncation.
4. **Support multi-file PDF extraction**: Extend `get_item_fulltext` to optionally extract from all available PDF attachments.
