Current approaches predominantly utilize a\\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\\nsemantic interpretation.
