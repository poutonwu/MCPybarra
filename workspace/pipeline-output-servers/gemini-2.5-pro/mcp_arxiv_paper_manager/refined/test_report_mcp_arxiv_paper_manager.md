## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `search_papers`

#### Step: Happy path: Search for papers related to 'machine learning' using default max_results (10).
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": "machine learning"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `[{"id": "2507.06233v1", ...` (partial valid output), but marked as error. Likely due to JSON parsing or truncation issue.

#### Step: Test custom limit: Search for 'quantum computing' with max_results set to 5.
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": "quantum computing", "max_results": 5}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Partial result returned; also likely due to output truncation or malformed JSON.

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when an empty query is provided.
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** `[]` — Expected behavior observed.

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when a negative max_results value is provided.
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": "AI ethics", "max_results": -5}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** `[]` — Expected behavior observed.

### Tool: `download_paper`

#### Step: Dependent call: Download the first paper from the previous search results.
- **Tool:** download_paper
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None..."` — Dependency resolution failed due to earlier search failure.

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to download a paper with a non-existent ID.
- **Tool:** download_paper
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": "9999.99999"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** `{"error": "Paper '9999.99999' not found."}` — Correct error message.

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when attempting to download a paper with special characters in the ID.
- **Tool:** download_paper
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": "2001.0!@#$.abc"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `{"error": "An unexpected error occurred: Page request resulted in HTTP 400 ..."}` — Invalid URL encoding may be the cause.

---

### Tool: `list_papers`

#### Step: Check that the downloaded paper is present in the local directory.
- **Tool:** list_papers
- **Parameters:** {}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** `[]` — Confirms no paper was successfully downloaded.

---

### Tool: `read_paper`

#### Step: Read content of the downloaded paper. Extract filename from download response message.
- **Tool:** read_paper
- **Parameters:** {"filename": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None..."` — Caused by prior step failure.

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to read a file that does not exist in the papers directory.
- **Tool:** read_paper
- **Parameters:** {"filename": "nonexistent_paper.pdf"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** `{"error": "File 'nonexistent_paper.pdf' not found."}` — Correct error handling.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
- All four tools (`search_papers`, `download_paper`, `list_papers`, `read_paper`) were tested.
- Core functionalities such as searching, downloading, listing, and reading papers were covered.
- Edge cases like invalid input values and missing files/IDs were included.

### Identified Issues

1. **Search Failures**
   - Both primary search tests failed despite returning partial data. This suggests improper handling of large JSON responses or truncation-related errors.
   
2. **Dependent Step Resolution**
   - A downstream test (`download_first_paper`) failed because it couldn't resolve a paper ID from a failed search step. Proper dependency chain management is needed.

3. **Special Characters in Paper ID**
   - The server failed to handle special characters in `paper_id`, leading to an improperly encoded URL and HTTP 400 error.

4. **JSON Output Truncation**
   - Search results appear to be truncated mid-response, which leads to invalid JSON and errors during parsing.

### Stateful Operations
- The test plan included a stateful operation (`download_first_paper`) that attempted to use the output of a prior search. Since the prior search failed, this step could not proceed. However, even if the search had succeeded, there's no guarantee the placeholder resolution logic would work correctly.

### Error Handling
- For most edge cases, the server responded with clear, descriptive error messages.
- However, in cases where the JSON structure was broken (e.g., due to truncation), the server incorrectly reported an error status instead of returning a well-formed error object.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server shows promise but has significant issues affecting its reliability and usability:

- **Critical Bug Fixes Needed:**
  - Fix search tool to return valid JSON even for long outputs.
  - Improve handling of special characters in URLs (especially in `paper_id`).
  - Ensure proper dependency resolution between steps in automated workflows.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Add logging for internal server operations to aid debugging.
  - Implement better validation and sanitization of inputs before making API calls.
  - Consider streaming or chunked output mechanisms for large search results to avoid memory or truncation issues.

- **Error Handling Improvements:**
  - Return structured error objects even when underlying JSON generation fails.
  - Use consistent error formats across all tools.
