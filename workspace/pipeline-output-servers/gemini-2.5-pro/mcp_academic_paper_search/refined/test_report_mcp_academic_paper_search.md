#### Step: Edge case: Test search_papers with an empty query.
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_papers: Query must be a non-empty string.

#### Step: Edge case: Test search_papers with a negative limit.

- **Parameters:** {"query": "quantum computing", "limit": -5}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_papers: Limit must be a positive integer.

#### Step: Stress test: Search with a large limit to test API behavior under load.
- **Tool:** search_papers
- **Parameters:** {"query": "blockchain technology", "limit": 100}
- **Status:** ✅ Success (with adapter truncation note)
- **Result:** Returned 22 papers successfully before being truncated due to adapter limitations.

### Tool: `fetch_paper_details`

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch details of the first paper returned from search_papers.
- **Tool:** fetch_paper_details
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": "10.1093/wentk/9780190602383.003.0002", "source": "Crossref"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** An unexpected error occurred: module 'httpx' has no attribute 'quote'

#### Step: Edge case: Fetch details with an invalid DOI.
- **Tool:** fetch_paper_details
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": "invalid-doi-123", "source": "Crossref"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** An unexpected error occurred: module 'httpx' has no attribute 'quote'

#### Step: Edge case: Fetch details with an invalid source.
- **Tool:** fetch_paper_details
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": "10.1109/5.771073", "source": "Invalid Source"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool fetch_paper_details: Source must be either 'Semantic Scholar' or 'Crossref'.

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch details of a paper from a larger search result.
- **Tool:** fetch_paper_details
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": null, "source": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency.

### Tool: `search_by_topic`

#### Step: Happy path: Search for papers on a specific topic with a valid year range and limit.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "machine learning", "year_range": "2010-2020", "limit": 5}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Failed to retrieve results from both Semantic Scholar and Crossref.

#### Step: Edge case: Test search_by_topic with an invalid year range (start > end).
- **Tool:** search_by_topic
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "deep learning", "year_range": "2020-2010"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Empty list returned, which is acceptable as it's not an error condition.

#### Step: Edge case: Test search_by_topic with a zero limit.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "neural networks", "limit": 0}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_by_topic: Limit must be a positive integer.

#### Step: Happy path: Search for papers without applying a year filter.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "climate change", "limit": 10}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully returned 10 papers related to climate change.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
- All three main tools (`search_papers`, `fetch_paper_details`, `search_by_topic`) were tested across happy paths, edge cases, and stress conditions.
- Dependent calls (e.g., using output from one tool as input for another) were also tested.

### Identified Issues
1. **`httpx.quote` Attribute Error**  
   - **Tools Affected:** `fetch_paper_details`
   - **Problem:** Use of `httpx.quote` where it does not exist; likely intended to use `urllib.parse.quote`.
   - **Impact:** Prevents proper encoding of DOIs when making requests to Crossref, causing failures.

2. **Search Fallback Mechanism Not Working**  
   - **Tools Affected:** `search_by_topic`
   - **Problem:** When Semantic Scholar fails, the fallback to Crossref doesn't produce results even though Crossref should return data.
   - **Impact:** Users may receive empty results despite relevant content existing in Crossref.

3. **Improper Handling of Invalid Year Range**  
   - **Tools Affected:** `search_by_topic`
   - **Problem:** Accepts reversed year ranges like "2020-2010" but returns an empty list instead of swapping them or raising an error.
   - **Impact:** May confuse users expecting results within that time frame.

### Stateful Operations
- Dependency handling (e.g., using output from `search_papers` to feed into `fetch_paper_details`) worked correctly when upstream steps succeeded.
- However, if the upstream step failed, dependent steps received `null` values and crashed.

### Error Handling
- Input validation is robust in most cases (e.g., empty queries, invalid limits), returning clear error messages.
- However, some internal errors (like missing attributes) are exposed to the user, indicating insufficient exception wrapping.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The server demonstrates solid functionality for basic and advanced paper searches, with good support for concurrent querying and filtering by topic/year. However, several bugs—particularly around URL encoding and fallback logic—prevent reliable operation in certain scenarios.

### Recommendations
1. Replace all instances of `httpx.quote` with `urllib.parse.quote`.
2. Improve fallback logic in `search_by_topic` to ensure Crossref is queried effectively when Semantic Scholar fails.
3. Add validation for reversed year ranges and swap them or raise a helpful warning.
4. Wrap internal exceptions in clearer error messages to improve user experience and debugging.
