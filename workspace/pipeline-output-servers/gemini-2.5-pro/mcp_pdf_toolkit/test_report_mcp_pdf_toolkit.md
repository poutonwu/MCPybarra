## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
- All major functionalities provided by the server (`merge`, `extract`, `search`, `ordered merge`, and `content similarity`) were tested.
- Both happy paths and edge cases were included, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

### Identified Issues
- No bugs or unexpected behavior were observed during testing.
- All error conditions were handled gracefully with descriptive error messages.

### Stateful Operations
- The dependent operation step confirmed that the system supports chaining operations where the output of one tool serves as input to another (e.g., extracting from a merged file).

### Error Handling
- Error messages are clear and informative.
- Invalid inputs (e.g., empty lists, out-of-range page numbers) were properly detected and reported.
- Tools like `find_related_pdfs` appropriately handle non-PDF files by returning meaningful errors.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion:
The `mcp_pdf_toolkit` server has been thoroughly tested and performs reliably under both normal and edge-case scenarios. It demonstrates robust functionality for PDF manipulation tasks and handles errors effectively.

### Recommendations:
- **Improve Documentation:** Consider adding more detailed API documentation or examples for users unfamiliar with the toolkit.
- **Add File Size Limits:** Introduce optional parameters for limiting file size in tools like `merge_pdfs` or `find_related_pdfs` to avoid performance issues with large documents.
- **Enhance Logging:** Add structured logging support for better traceability and debugging in production environments.
