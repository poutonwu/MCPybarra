# mcp_ssh_remote_manager

## Overview

`mcp_ssh_remote_manager` is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a set of tools for managing SSH connections to remote servers. It allows you to connect, execute commands, upload and download files, and manage sessionsâ€”all through a structured JSON-based interface designed for integration with large language models.

This server enables automation of remote operations such as executing shell commands, transferring files via SFTP, and managing multiple SSH sessions in memory.
