#### Step: Test handling of unsupported URL schemes like FTP
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "ftp://example.com/file.html"}`

**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "data:text/plain,This is not base64 encoded text"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Correctly identified invalid Data URI format but could provide more specific guidance

#### Step: Attempt to convert a non-existent local file
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nonexistent_file.html"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Correctly identified missing file with clear error message

#### Step: Security test - Attempt a path traversal attack
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "..\\..\\malicious\\file.txt"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Correctly blocked path traversal attempt with clear security warning

#### Step: Test handling of Data URI with invalid base64 data
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "data:text/html;base64,invalid_base64_data"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Correctly identified base64 decoding failure with detailed error

#### Step: Performance test - Attempt to process a large file
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\multi_merged_output.zip"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** File reading failed due to binary content not being UTF-8 encoded

#### Step: Attempt to convert a binary file
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\app.ico"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** File reading failed due to binary content not being UTF-8 encoded

#### Step: Test handling of malformed URLs
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "htp:/example.com"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Incorrectly treated as a file path rather than identifying malformed URL

#### Step: Test handling of files with Unicode characters in filenames
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\《上海市道路交通管理条例》.pdf"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** File reading failed due to encoding issues with PDF content

#### Step: Dependent call using output from previous conversion
**Tool:** convert_to_markdown  
**Parameters:** `{"source": "\n# Test\n\n"}`  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Tool incorrectly tried to interpret raw Markdown as a file path

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The main functionalities were tested:
- URL detection and processing
- Data URI parsing and decoding
- Local file reading with security checks
- HTML to Markdown conversion

However, there was limited testing of:
- Complex HTML structures
- Different character encodings beyond UTF-8
- Advanced security scenarios

### Identified Issues
1. **Incorrect scheme detection**: The tool fails to properly identify unsupported URL schemes like FTP and incorrectly treats them as file paths.
2. **Path validation limitations**: While basic path traversal is blocked, more complex attempts might still be possible.
3. **Binary file handling**: The tool doesn't handle binary files gracefully, expecting all input to be UTF-8 encoded text.
4. **Unicode filename support**: While the code handles Unicode in paths, actual file reading fails for certain encodings.
5. **Chaining behavior**: Using Markdown output as new input results in incorrect interpretation as a file path.

### Stateful Operations
The test included one dependent operation where the output from a Data URI conversion was used as input. This failed because the tool couldn't distinguish between a literal string and a file path.

### Error Handling
Error handling is generally good with clear messages for most cases:
- Empty inputs are correctly rejected
- Security checks provide informative messages
- Decoding errors include details about what went wrong

However, some error categorization could be improved:
- Unsupported URL schemes should raise a specific error type
- Binary file attempts should have a dedicated error message

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The markdown_converter server demonstrates solid core functionality for converting content from supported sources to Markdown. It includes important security checks and provides generally clear error messages. However, several areas need improvement:

**Recommendations:**
1. Improve URL scheme detection to clearly identify unsupported protocols
2. Add explicit binary file detection before attempting UTF-8 decoding
3. Enhance error categorization with specific exception types for different failure modes
4. Implement better handling of chained operations by distinguishing between content and file paths
5. Add input validation for file extensions to prevent attempting to convert non-text files
6. Consider adding optional encoding detection for local files instead of enforcing UTF-8
