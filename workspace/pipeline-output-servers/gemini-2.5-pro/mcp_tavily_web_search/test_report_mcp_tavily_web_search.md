# Tavily MCP Server Test Report

## 1. Test Summary

**Server:** tavily_server  
**Objective:** The server provides three tools for interacting with the Tavily API: `tavily_web_search` for general web searches, `tavily_answer_search` for question-answering, and `tavily_news_search` for news article retrieval. These tools allow for domain filtering, result limiting, and time-based constraints.

**Overall Result:** Passed with minor issues  
**Key Statistics:**
- Total Tests Executed: 10
- Successful Tests: 8
- Failed Tests: 2

## 2. Test Environment

**Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution  
**MCP Server Tools:**
- tavily_web_search
- tavily_answer_search
- tavily_news_search

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Web Search Functionality

#### ✅ Success - Happy path: Perform a basic web search for recent AI advancements with default parameters.
- **Tool:** tavily_web_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "latest advancements in AI"}
- **Result:** Successfully returned 5 results about AI trends from various sources including Appinventiv, Crescendo.ai, and ScienceDaily.

#### ✅ Success - Happy path: Perform an advanced web search focused on a specific domain with limited results.
- **Tool:** tavily_web_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "AI ethics in healthcare", "search_depth": "advanced", "include_domains": ["aiethicsjournal.org"], "max_results": 3}
- **Result:** Successfully retrieved 3 articles specifically from aiethicsjournal.org discussing ethical issues in AI healthcare applications.

#### ✅ Success - Happy path: Perform a web search while excluding a known biased review site.
- **Tool:** tavily_web_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "best smartphones 2025", "exclude_domains": ["biasharatings.net"]}
- **Result:** Successfully returned smartphone reviews from YouTube, PCMag, Tom's Guide, and GSM Arena without any results from biasharatings.net.

### Answer Search Functionality

#### ✅ Success - Dependent call: Use answer search to extract a factual URL from web context derived from previous search patterns.
- **Tool:** tavily_answer_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "What is the official website of CERN?", "max_results": 2}
- **Result:** Correctly identified that the official website of CERN is https://home.cern/ based on supporting evidence from Wikipedia and the actual CERN site.

#### ❌ Failure - Edge case: Test handling of empty query input for answer search.
- **Tool:** tavily_answer_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Result:** Returned expected validation error: "The 'query' parameter must be a non-empty string."

#### ✅ Success - Dependent call: Attempt to get a synthesized answer based on recent news context.
- **Tool:** tavily_answer_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "What was the outcome of the latest UN climate conference?", "max_results": 4}
- **Result:** Provided a concise answer about the UN climate conference in Baku concluding with a commitment to deliver $300 billion annually to developing countries by 2035.

### News Search Functionality

#### ✅ Success - Happy path: Search for recent news articles within a specified time frame and domain.
- **Tool:** tavily_news_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "global AI policy summit", "max_days_ago": 10, "include_domains": ["govtechnews.com"]}
- **Result:** Successfully executed but returned an empty array, indicating no matching articles were found.

#### ✅ Success - Happy path: Search while explicitly excluding a potentially unreliable domain.
- **Tool:** tavily_news_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "climate change", "exclude_domains": ["examplefakenews.com"]}
- **Result:** Successfully returned articles about climate change from Nature, Time, and other reputable sources without any results from examplefakenews.com.

#### ❌ Failure - Edge case: Test server behavior when max_days_ago exceeds allowed range (should return validation error).
- **Tool:** tavily_news_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "stock market trends", "max_days_ago": 500}
- **Result:** Returned expected validation error: "The 'max_days_ago' parameter must be an integer between 1 and 365."

#### ✅ Success - Edge case: Test server behavior when max_results is an invalid (negative) integer.
- **Tool:** tavily_web_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "quantum computing breakthroughs", "max_results": -1}
- **Result:** Correctly returned validation error: "The 'max_results' parameter must be a positive integer."

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all main functionalities of the server:
- Basic and advanced web searches with domain filtering
- Answer generation with supporting evidence
- News searches with date filtering and domain exclusion
- Error handling for edge cases like empty queries and invalid parameters

### Identified Issues
1. **Empty Query Handling**: The `tavily_answer_search` tool correctly handled empty queries by returning a validation error.
2. **Parameter Validation**: Both `tavily_web_search` and `tavily_news_search` properly validated their numeric parameters (`max_results`, `max_days_ago`) and returned clear error messages.

### Stateful Operations
The tests did not involve stateful operations or dependent steps beyond using information from one search to inform another (e.g., using `tavily_web_search` results to shape an `tavily_answer_search` query). In these cases, the server performed as expected.

### Error Handling
The server demonstrated robust error handling:
- Clear validation errors for missing or invalid parameters
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- Proper separation of success and error responses in JSON format
- Consistent error structure across all tools

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The Tavily MCP server demonstrates solid functionality and robust error handling. All core features work as intended, and the server properly handles both valid and invalid inputs. The two failed tests were expected edge cases that resulted in appropriate validation errors.

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider adding more comprehensive documentation for the tools, particularly around what constitutes an "advanced" vs "basic" search depth.
2. Implement rate-limiting or request throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse of the API.
3. Enhance response metadata to include additional search statistics (e.g., number of documents searched, confidence scores).
4. Add support for more granular content filtering options (e.g., language, region).
