<thought>My research is complete, and I have gathered enough information to create the implementation plan.

Here's a summary of my findings:
1.  **Library**: The correct library is `tavily-python`.
2.  **Client Initialization**: I will need a `TavilyClient` instance, initialized with an API key. The plan should assume the API key is available as an environment variable for security.
3.  **Tool 1: `tavily_web_search`**: The `tavily_client.search` method is the correct one. My research confirms it accepts the following parameters, which directly map to the user's request:
    *   `query` (str)
    *   `search_depth` (str, 'basic' or 'advanced')
    *   `include_domains` (List[str])
    *   `exclude_domains` (List[str])
    *   `max_results` (int)
4.  **Tool 2: `tavily_answer_search`**: The GitHub repository mentioned a `qna_search` method, which seems to be an alias or a specific use case of the main `search` method with `include_answer=True`. The `search` method itself can return a direct answer. I will design the tool to use `tavily_client.search` and ensure the `include_answer=True` parameter is set. The user request specifies this should default to an 'advanced' search.
    *   `query` (str)
    *   `max_results` (int)
    *   It will internally use `search_depth='advanced'` and `include_answer=True`.
5.  **Tool 3: `tavily_news_search`**: The user wants to search for recent news and filter by source. While there isn't a dedicated `news_search` function in the SDK, this can be achieved by using the `tavily_client.search` method and setting the `topic` parameter to `"news"`. The time-limiting requirement can be met with the `max_days_ago` parameter. The source filtering maps directly to `include_domains` and `exclude_domains`.
    *   `query` (str)
    *   `max_days_ago` (int)
    *   `include_domains` (List[str])
    *   `exclude_domains` (List[str])
    *   `max_results` (int)
    *   It will internally use `topic="news"`.

The response format for all tools seems to be a dictionary containing a list of results, where each result is a dictionary with `title`, `url`, and `content` (`content` is the key for the summary). For the answer search, there will be an additional top-level `answer` key in the response.

I will structure the final plan with these three tools, a single file (`mcp_tavily_server.py`), and the necessary dependencies (`mcp`, `tavily-python`, and `python-dotenv` for managing the API key). The plan will be detailed and actionable, following all the specified output requirements.### **1. MCP Tools Plan**

This section details the tools to be implemented in the MCP server. Each tool corresponds to a specific function of the Tavily API.

---

#### **Tool 1: Comprehensive Web Search**

*   **Function Name**: `tavily_web_search`
*   **Description**: Performs a comprehensive web search using the Tavily API. It supports customizable search depth and allows for fine-grained control over the search scope by including or excluding specific domains.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `query` (str): The search query string. (Required)
    *   `search_depth` (str, optional): The depth of the search. Can be 'basic' for quick results or 'advanced' for more in-depth analysis. Defaults to 'basic'.
    *   `include_domains` (List[str], optional): A list of domains to specifically include in the search results.
    *   `exclude_domains` (List[str], optional): A list of domains to specifically exclude from the search results.
    *   `max_results` (int, optional): The maximum number of search results to return. Defaults to 5.
*   **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a search result and contains the following keys: `title` (str), `url` (str), and `content` (str).

---

#### **Tool 2: Direct Answer Search**

*   **Function Name**: `tavily_answer_search`
*   **Description**: Conducts a search to find a direct answer to a specific question. This tool leverages Tavily's advanced search capabilities to generate a concise answer supported by evidence from search results.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `query` (str): The question or query for which a direct answer is sought. (Required)
    *   `max_results` (int, optional): The maximum number of supporting search results to return alongside the answer. Defaults to 5.
*   **Return Value**: A dictionary containing two keys: `answer` (str), which holds the direct answer to the query, and `results` (List[dict]), a list of search result dictionaries that support the answer. Each result dictionary contains `title`, `url`, and `content`.

---

#### **Tool 3: News Search**

*   **Function Name**: `tavily_news_search`
*   **Description**: Specializes in searching for recent news articles. It allows filtering articles by their publication date (up to 365 days old) and by specific news sources.
*   **Parameters**:
    *   `query` (str): The topic or keyword for the news search. (Required)
    *   `max_days_ago` (int, optional): The maximum age of the news articles in days. Must be between 1 and 365. Defaults to 7.
    *   `include_domains` (List[str], optional): A list of news source domains to specifically include in the search (e.g., `['reuters.com', 'apnews.com']`).
    *   `exclude_domains` (List[str], optional): A list of news source domains to specifically exclude from the search.
    *   `max_results` (int, optional): The maximum number of news articles to return. Defaults to 5.
*   **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a news article and contains the following keys: `title` (str), `url` (str), and `content` (str).

### **2. Server Overview**

The MCP server will provide automated web search processing functionalities by acting as a bridge to the Tavily API. It will expose three distinct tools: `tavily_web_search` for general, scope-controlled searches; `tavily_answer_search` for generating direct answers to questions with supporting evidence; and `tavily_news_search` for retrieving timely news articles with source and recency filtering. All tools will return structured, easy-to-parse results.

### **3. File to be Generated**

All the server logic, including MCP initialization and tool definitions, will be contained within a single Python file.

*   **File Name**: `mcp_tavily_server.py`

### **4. Dependencies**

The following third-party Python libraries are required for the server implementation. They should be installed via pip.

*   `mcp`: The core SDK for creating the MCP server.
*   `tavily-python`: The official Python client for interacting with the Tavily API.
*   `python-dotenv`: To securely manage the Tavily API key by loading it from a `.env` file.
