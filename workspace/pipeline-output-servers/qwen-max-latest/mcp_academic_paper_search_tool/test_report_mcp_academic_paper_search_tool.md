### search_by_topic_tool Tests

#### Step: Happy path: Search for papers on 'AI ethics' published between 2015 and 2020, returning up to 5 results.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic_tool
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "AI ethics", "year_range_start": 2015, "year_range_end": 2020, "max_results": 5}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Tool 'search_by_topic_tool' execution timed out (exceeded 60 seconds)

#### Step: Happy path: Search for 'quantum computing' without year range filtering to test default behavior.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic_tool
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "quantum computing", "max_results": 3}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Tool 'search_by_topic_tool' execution timed out (exceeded 60 seconds)

#### Step: Edge case: Search for papers within a future year range that likely has no results.
- **Tool:** search_by_topic_tool
- **Parameters:** {"topic_keywords": "climate change prediction", "year_range_start": 2090, "year_range_end": 2100, "max_results": 2}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Tool 'search_by_topic_tool' execution timed out (exceeded 60 seconds)

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch details of the first paper from the topic-based search using Crossref as the source.
- **Tool:** fetch_paper_details_tool
- **Parameters:** {"paper_id": null, "source": "Crossref"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_by_topic_happy_path[0].doi'

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all three available tools:
- search_papers_tool: Tested with various keyword scenarios including edge cases
- fetch_paper_details_tool: Tested with both valid and invalid IDs
- search_by_topic_tool: Tested with different time ranges and topics

However, several key functionalities were not fully tested due to failures:
- Proper handling of successful paper detail fetching
- Year range filtering functionality in search_by_topic_tool
- Proper error handling for most edge cases

### Identified Issues

1. **Missing DOI Attribute in Paper Objects**
   - All calls to search_papers_tool failed with `'Paper' object has no attribute 'doi'`
   - This indicates a fundamental issue with the data model or API integration
   - Impact: Prevents proper identification and follow-up lookup of papers

2. **Timeout Issues in search_by_topic_tool**
   - Multiple calls to search_by_topic_tool timed out after 60 seconds
   - Suggests potential performance issues or blocking operations
   - Impact: Makes the tool unusable for production environments

3. **Invalid Parameter Handling in search_papers_tool**
   - Empty keywords caused errors about missing 'query' parameter
   - Zero max_results caused validation errors
   - Impact: Poor user experience and unclear error messages

4. **Unreliable Dependent Calls**
   - Both dependent calls failed because they relied on outputs from failed steps
   - Indicates cascading failures due to initial tool problems
   - Impact: Breaks workflow that requires chaining multiple tools together

### Stateful Operations
The server did not properly handle stateful operations because:
- The initial search operations failed, preventing any meaningful follow-up operations
- When attempting to use output from previous steps, parameters resolved to null
- No successful chains of operations were completed

### Error Handling
Error handling was inconsistent:
- Some errors provided clear messages (e.g., "Missing required parameter")
- Other errors exposed internal implementation details (e.g., Python exceptions)
- Timeout errors lacked specific diagnostic information
- There was no consistent format for error responses

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The server is currently not functional for its intended purpose. All tests failed due to either critical bugs or timeout issues. The primary issue appears to be a mismatch between expected and actual attributes in the paper objects returned by the SemanticScholar API integration.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix DOI Attribute Issue**
   - Investigate the SemanticScholar API response structure
   - Update code to correctly extract DOI values
   - Add validation to ensure required fields exist before accessing them

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement consistent error formatting across all tools
   - Add input validation at tool entry points
   - Provide clearer error messages for common failure scenarios

3. **Address Performance Issues**
   - Optimize search_by_topic_tool to complete within reasonable timeframes
   - Consider implementing asynchronous processing for long-running queries
   - Add timeouts and cancellation support for backend API calls

4. **Enhance Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add unit tests for individual components
   - Implement mocking for external API dependencies
   - Create integration tests with real API endpoints

5. **Improve Documentation**
   - Clarify expected parameters and their constraints
   - Document known limitations of external API integrations
   - Specify expected response formats for both success and error cases

6. **Implement Better Validation**
   - Validate that max_results is between 1 and 100 before making API calls
   - Handle empty keywords more gracefully with appropriate error messages
   - Add validation for paper IDs before attempting to fetch details
