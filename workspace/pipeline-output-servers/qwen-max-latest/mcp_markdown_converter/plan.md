### MCP Tools Plan

#### Tool: `convert_to_markdown`
- **Description**: Converts various types of content (HTTP/HTTPS webpages, local files, and data URIs) into structured Markdown format while preserving structural elements such as headings, lists, links, and tables.
- **Parameters**:
  - `content_url` (str): The URL or path to the content that needs to be converted. This could be an HTTP/HTTPS webpage, a local file path, or a data URI.
  - `content_type` (str): The type of content being provided (e.g., "http", "https", "file", "data_uri").
- **Return Value**: A string containing the content converted into Markdown format.

### Server Overview
The server will act as an MCP-compliant service that offers a single tool called `convert_to_markdown`. This tool is designed to take in various forms of content—ranging from HTTP/HTTPS webpages, local files, to data URIs—and convert them into a structured Markdown format. It ensures that the original structure of the content, including headings, lists, links, and tables, is preserved in the output.

### File to be Generated
- **File Name**: `mcp_markdown_converter.py`

### Dependencies
- `markitdown`: For converting HTML and other formats to Markdown.
- `requests`: To fetch content from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
- `pygments`: For syntax highlighting if code blocks are included in the conversion.
- `beautifulsoup4`: To parse and extract structured content from HTML pages.

This plan outlines how to implement an MCP server based on the user's request for a markdown converter using the `markitdown` library. The server will expose the `convert_to_markdown` tool, which can handle different types of input sources and convert them into Markdown while maintaining the original document's structure. All functionalities will be encapsulated within a single Python file named `mcp_markdown_converter.py`, with dependencies on external libraries such as `markitdown`, `requests`, `pygments`, and `beautifulsoup4` for full functionality.
