- **Parameters**:
  - `source_path` (str): The file path of the image to apply the filter on.
  - `destination_path` (str): The file path where the filtered image will be saved.
  - `filter_type` (str): The type of filter to apply (e.g., 'blur', 'sharpen').
- **Return Value**: Returns the file path (str) of the filtered image.

#### Tool: `detect_edges_tool`
- **Description**: Detects edges in an image using edge detection algorithms and saves the result to a new destination path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `source_path` (str): The file path of the image to detect edges.
  - `destination_path` (str): The file path where the edge-detected image will be saved.
- **Return Value**: Returns the file path (str) of the edge-detected image.

#### Tool: `apply_threshold_tool`
- **Description**: Applies a threshold to an image, converting it to a binary image, and saves the result to a new destination path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `source_path` (str): The file path of the image to apply the threshold on.
  - `destination_path` (str): The file path where the thresholded image will be saved.
  - `threshold_value` (int): The threshold value for binarization.
- **Return Value**: Returns the file path (str) of the thresholded image.

#### Tool: `detect_contours_tool`
- **Description**: Detects contours in an image and saves the contour-detected image to a new destination path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `source_path` (str): The file path of the image to detect contours.
  - `destination_path` (str): The file path where the contour-detected image will be saved.
- **Return Value**: Returns the file path (str) of the contour-detected image.

#### Tool: `find_shapes_tool`
- **Description**: Finds shapes in an image using contour detection and saves the shape-detected image to a new destination path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `source_path` (str): The file path of the image to find shapes.
  - `destination_path` (str): The file path where the shape-detected image will be saved.
- **Return Value**: Returns the file path (str) of the shape-detected image.

### 2. Server Overview
The server is designed to integrate with OpenCV to provide a suite of image processing and computer vision functionalities. All image operations are performed by passing file paths rather than binary data, ensuring that images are read from and written to disk. This approach aligns with the user request to handle images through their file paths exclusively.

### 3. File to be Generated
The entire logic for the server and its tools will be contained within a single Python file named `mcp_opencv_server.py`.

### 4. Dependencies
- `opencv-python`: A library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
- `numpy`: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
