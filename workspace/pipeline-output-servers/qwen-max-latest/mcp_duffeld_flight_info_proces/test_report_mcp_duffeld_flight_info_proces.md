## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
All core functionalities were tested:
- One-way flight search ✅
- Round-trip flight search ✅
- Offer detail retrieval ✅
- Multi-city itineraries ✅

However, all tests failed due to a single critical issue.

### Identified Issues

1. **Authentication Interface Mismatch**
   - All external calls to `FlightData` require a password, but the current implementation only passes an API key.
   - The `login()` method expects both username/password, but the code only supplies the API key as a token.
   - This affects every tool that interacts with the external service.

2. **Dependent Call Failures**
   - The dependent step (`get_offer_details_from_search`) failed because the upstream step did not succeed.
   - While this is expected behavior, it highlights how cascading failures can impact workflow integrity.

### Stateful Operations
No stateful operations could be validated due to authentication errors. Any intended state transfer between steps (e.g., passing `offer_id`) failed because initial steps never succeeded.

### Error Handling
The server handled input validation correctly:
- Missing/empty parameters were caught and returned meaningful messages.
- Invalid values (like unsupported flight types) were flagged clearly.
- Structural constraints (like minimum number of cities) were enforced.

However, integration-level errors (e.g., login issues) were not gracefully handled beyond propagating the raw exception.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
Despite correct internal validation and error messaging, the server failed entirely due to a mismatch in the external API authentication interface. No actual flight data was retrieved during testing.

### Recommendations
1. **Update Authentication Logic:**
   - Investigate whether the `FlightData.login()` method supports token-based authentication or if it strictly requires username/password credentials.
   - If using token auth, update the client usage accordingly or consider switching to a compatible library/sdk.

2. **Improve External Dependency Management:**
   - Mock or stub external services during testing to isolate internal logic.
   - Add better error context when calling external APIs (e.g., distinguish between network, auth, and query errors).

3. **Enhance Logging and Diagnostics:**
   - Include more context in error logs, especially around failed external integrations.

4. **Refactor Login Flow:**
   - Move login outside of each function call into a centralized setup routine unless per-call re-authentication is necessary.
