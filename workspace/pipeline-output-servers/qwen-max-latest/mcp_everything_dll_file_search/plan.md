### MCP Tools Plan

#### Tool 1: `search_files`
- **Description**: Search for files and folders on Windows using various search criteria such as wildcards, regular expressions, paths, sizes, times, attributes, etc. This tool will load the `everything.dll` file using `ctypes` to perform high-speed searches.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: (str) The search query including keywords, wildcards, or regex patterns.
  - `path`: (str, optional) The root directory path to start the search from. Defaults to the entire system.
  - `size_min`: (int, optional) Minimum file size in bytes.
  - `size_max`: (int, optional) Maximum file size in bytes.
  - `date_modified_start`: (str, optional) Start date for filtering by modification time (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - `date_modified_end`: (str, optional) End date for filtering by modification time (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - `attributes`: (list of str, optional) List of file attributes to filter by (e.g., 'readonly', 'hidden').
  - `sort_by`: (str, optional) Sorting criteria ('name', 'size', 'date').
  - `case_sensitive`: (bool, optional) If True, the search is case-sensitive.
  - `whole_word`: (bool, optional) If True, only whole word matches are returned.
  - `regex`: (bool, optional) If True, the query is treated as a regular expression.
- **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains detailed information about a found file or folder, including name, path, size, modification time, and attributes.

### Server Overview
The server's purpose is to provide an automation tool for file retrieval and processing on Windows systems. It leverages the capabilities of the `everything.dll` to offer high-speed searching with advanced filtering options. Users can specify complex queries that include wildcards, regular expressions, size limits, date ranges, and more. The server returns detailed information about matching files and folders, sorted according to user preferences.

### File to be Generated
- `mcp_file_search_server.py`

### Dependencies
- `ctypes`: To interface with the `everything.dll` for performing searches.
- No additional third-party libraries are required since `ctypes` is part of the Python Standard Library.

This plan strictly adheres to the user's request, focusing on creating a robust file search server based on the specified functionalities without adding any extraneous features or tools.
