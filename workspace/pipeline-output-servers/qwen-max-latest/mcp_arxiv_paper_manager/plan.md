### **MCP Tools Plan**

#### Tool 1: `search_papers`
- **Description**: Searches arXiv for papers based on a user-provided query and returns a list of matching papers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: str - The search query to be used for finding relevant arXiv papers (e.g., "quantum computing").
- **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details about a paper such as its title, authors, abstract, and arXiv ID.

#### Tool 2: `download_paper`
- **Description**: Downloads the PDF of a specified arXiv paper using its arXiv ID and saves it locally.
- **Parameters**:
  - `paper_id`: str - The unique arXiv identifier for the paper (e.g., "2107.12345v1").
- **Return Value**: A string indicating the success or failure of the download operation and the local file path where the paper is stored.

#### Tool 3: `list_papers`
- **Description**: Lists all papers that have been downloaded and stored locally, with optional filtering capabilities.
- **Parameters**:
  - `filter_query`: str (optional) - A keyword to filter the list of papers by title or author.
- **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a locally stored paper, including its title, authors, and file path.

#### Tool 4: `read_paper`
- **Description**: Reads the content of a specified paper from the local storage and provides access to its text.
- **Parameters**:
  - `paper_id`: str - The unique arXiv identifier for the paper (e.g., "2107.12345v1").
- **Return Value**: A string containing the text content of the paper, if available.

### **Server Overview**
The MCP server will automate the process of searching, downloading, managing, and reading academic papers from arXiv. It will provide tools for users to search for papers based on specific queries, download selected papers in PDF format, manage the downloaded papers through listing functionalities, and read the content of any downloaded paper.

### **File to be Generated**
- **Filename**: `mcp_server.py`

### **Dependencies**
- `arxiv` - A Python library for interacting with the arXiv API to search for papers.
- `requests` - To handle HTTP requests for downloading papers.
- `PyPDF2` - For reading the content of PDF files.
- `os` - For handling file paths and directory operations (standard library).
- `mcp[cli]` - For implementing the MCP protocol and server functionalities.

This plan outlines the necessary components and dependencies to build an MCP server tailored to the user's request for automating interactions with arXiv papers. All functionalities are directly derived from the user's specifications without adding extraneous features.
