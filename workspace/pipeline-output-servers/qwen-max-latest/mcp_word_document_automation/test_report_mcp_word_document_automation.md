## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covers a broad range of functionalities:
- Document lifecycle: creation, opening, saving, copying
- Content manipulation: paragraphs, headings, tables, sections
- Formatting: page margins, table merging/splitting
- Search and replace
- Metadata retrieval

Only a few edge cases were tested (e.g., negative paragraph index), suggesting room for more exhaustive boundary testing.

### Identified Issues
- **Issue:** The `edit_section_by_keyword` tool failed because the keyword could not be found.
  - **Cause:** Possibly due to prior deletion of the paragraph containing the keyword.
  - **Impact:** May affect workflows relying on keyword-based document edits if the keyword is removed earlier.

### Stateful Operations
All dependent operations succeeded:
- Document state was preserved across multiple steps (adding, editing, deleting)
- File paths from `save_as` were reused correctly in subsequent `open_document` calls
- Table indices remained valid after modification (e.g., splitting)

### Error Handling
- Exception handling is robust and returns meaningful JSON error messages.
- Input validation is present (e.g., level bounds for headings, positive row/column counts for tables).
- Invalid indices are caught gracefully (e.g., negative paragraph index).

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The `mcp_word_document_automation` server performs reliably across a wide range of document automation tasks. All core functions behave as expected, and the system handles both successful and error scenarios consistently.

### Recommendations
- Enhance edge case coverage in the test plan (e.g., max-length strings, zero-sized tables).
- Consider returning more detailed error codes or structured errors for better integration.
- Improve documentation for complex operations like table merging and splitting.
- Optionally allow partial matching or regex support in `edit_section_by_keyword`.
