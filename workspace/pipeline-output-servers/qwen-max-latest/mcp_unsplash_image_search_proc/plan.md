### 1. **MCP Tools Plan**

#### Tool: `search_photos`
- **Description**:  
  Searches for photos on the Unsplash platform based on specified criteria such as keywords, pagination, sorting order, color, and image orientation. Returns detailed information about each photo including its ID, description, multiple size URLs, width, and height.

- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (str): The keyword(s) to search for in photos.
  - `page` (int): The page number of the results to retrieve (default is 1).
  - `per_page` (int): The number of photos per page (default is 10).
  - `order_by` (str): The sort order for the photos (`"latest"`, `"relevant"`, or `"popular"`).
  - `color` (str): Filter results by color (`"black_and_white"`, `"black"`, `"white"`, `"yellow"`, `"orange"`, `"red"`, `"purple"`, `"magenta"`, `"green"`, `"teal"`, `"blue"`).
  - `orientation` (str): Filter by photo orientation (`"landscape"`, `"portrait"`, `"squarish"`).

- **Return Value**:  
  A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the following keys:
  - `id` (str): Unique identifier for the photo.
  - `description` (str): Description of the photo (if available).
  - `urls` (dict): Dictionary containing URLs for different photo sizes (`"raw"`, `"full"`, `"regular"`, `"small"`, `"thumb"`).

### 2. **Server Overview**
The MCP server will be designed to automate image retrieval and processing, specifically focusing on searching for images from the Unsplash platform. It will expose a single tool named `search_photos`, which allows users to filter and retrieve images based on various parameters such as keywords, pagination, sorting order, color, and orientation. This functionality aligns with the user's request to build an automated image retrieval system.

### 3. **File to be Generated**
All logic will be implemented in a single Python file named `mcp_server.py`.

### 4. **Dependencies**
- `httpx`: For making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Unsplash API.
- `mcp[cli]`: The MCP SDK for building the server.
- `pydantic`: Optional, for validating input parameters if needed.
