- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: An unexpected error occurred: Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed.

#### ❌ Test: Test filtering results by color (yellow).
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "flowers", "color": "yellow"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: An unexpected error occurred: Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed.

#### ❌ Test: Test filtering results by portrait orientation.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "architecture", "orientation": "portrait"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: An unexpected error occurred: Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed.

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with an empty query string to trigger input validation error.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: 'query' must be a non-empty string.

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with invalid page number (less than 1).
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "sunset", "page": 0}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: 'page' must be greater than or equal to 1.

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with per_page value exceeding maximum allowed (100).
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "forest", "per_page": 150}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: 'per_page' must be between 1 and 100.

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with an invalid order_by value.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "city", "order_by": "trending"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: Invalid 'order_by'. Must be one of ['latest', 'relevant', 'popular'].

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with an unsupported color filter.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "sky", "color": "pink"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: Invalid 'color'. Must be one of ['black_and_white', 'black', 'white', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red', 'purple', 'magenta', 'green', 'teal', 'blue'].

#### ❌ Test: Edge case: Test with an invalid orientation value.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": "beach", "orientation": "circular"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_photos: Value error: Invalid 'orientation'. Must be one of ['landscape', 'portrait', 'squarish'].

#### ❌ Test: Dependent call: Use a description from a previous search as the new query input.
- **Tool:** search_photos
- **Parameters:** {"query": null, "page": 1, "per_page": 1}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_valid_query[0].description'

## 4. Analysis and Findings

**Functionality Coverage:** The test plan covered all main functionalities described in the tool's documentation including basic search, pagination, sorting, color filtering, and orientation filtering. Edge cases were also tested.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Critical Resource Management Issue**: All tests after the first one failed with "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed." This indicates a serious flaw in resource management where the HTTP client is being closed prematurely after the first request, making subsequent requests impossible.
2. **Input Validation Issues**: While some validation errors were properly handled (empty query, invalid page numbers), these failures still represent incomplete functionality coverage since the core functionality cannot be executed.
3. **Dependent Operation Failure**: The dependent operation test failed because it couldn't access results from a previous search, likely due to the same underlying issue affecting all tests after the first.

**Stateful Operations:** The server attempted to handle dependent operations by referencing previous outputs, but this functionality could not be fully tested due to earlier failures.

**Error Handling:** The server demonstrates good error handling practices by providing specific error messages for invalid inputs. However, the fundamental architectural flaw prevents most of these error handling mechanisms from being effective in practice.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The unsplash_image_search server implementation contains a critical architectural flaw that prevents the service from functioning correctly. Despite having proper input validation and error handling logic, the server closes the HTTP client connection after the first request, making all subsequent requests fail.

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix the resource management issue by ensuring the HTTP client remains open for the lifetime of the server instance.
2. Consider implementing connection pooling or reconnection logic to improve reliability.
3. Add automated health checks to detect when the client connection is closed unexpectedly.
4. Implement retry logic for failed requests where appropriate.
5. Verify that all error messages are consistently formatted and provide actionable information for users.
