# MCP Server Implementation Plan for Outlook Management

## Server Overview
The purpose of the server is to provide an MCP-based automation interface for managing local Outlook clients using the `win32` library. The server will expose tools to list folders, retrieve recent emails, search emails by keywords or contacts, fetch detailed email content, reply to specific emails, and compose new emails.
