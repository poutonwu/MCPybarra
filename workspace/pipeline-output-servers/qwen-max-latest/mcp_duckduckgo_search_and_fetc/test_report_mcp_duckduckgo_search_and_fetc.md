## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `search_and_fetch`

#### Step: Happy path: Search for 'artificial intelligence' with default number of results (5).
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": "artificial intelligence"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Error occurred during DuckDuckGo search: https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit

---

#### Step: Happy path: Search for 'climate change' and fetch only 3 results.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": "climate change", "num_results": 3}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Error occurred during DuckDuckGo search: https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test the server's handling of an empty query string.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Query must be a non-empty string.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test the server's handling of a negative num_results parameter.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": "quantum computing", "num_results": -2}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: num_results must be a positive integer.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test the server's handling of a non-string query input.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": 12345}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Error occurred during DuckDuckGo search: https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/ 202 Ratelimit

---

#### Step: Stress test: Request a large number of results to evaluate performance and limit handling.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": "space exploration", "num_results": 20}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Error occurred during DuckDuckGo search: https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/ 202 Ratelimit

---

#### Step: Search for content that will be used in a dependent extraction step.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": "latest advancements in robotics"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_and_fetch: Error occurred during DuckDuckGo search: https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit

---

#### Step: Dependent call: Use the title from the first search result as the new query for another search.
- **Tool:** search_and_fetch
- **Parameters:** {"query": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_for_extraction[0].title'

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage:
The test plan thoroughly covered the main functionalities of the `search_and_fetch` tool, including:
- Basic search operations
- Input validation
- Customization of result count
- Handling edge cases
- Stress testing
- Dependency chaining

However, all tests failed due to rate limiting or missing dependencies, preventing full evaluation of expected behavior.

### Identified Issues:

1. **Rate Limiting / API Access Issue**
   - All direct DuckDuckGo searches failed with `202 Ratelimit`.
   - This suggests either excessive usage or lack of proper authentication for unrestricted access.
   - Impact: Severely limits usability of the tool in its current form.

2. **Failure to Handle Missing Dependencies Gracefully**
   - The dependent step failed because it could not resolve a previous output due to prior failure.
   - While this is expected in a chain, better error messages or retry logic could improve robustness.

3. **Input Validation Inconsistency**
   - Some invalid inputs (like empty query) were caught by internal validation.
   - Others (like non-string queries) passed through to the DuckDuckGo API before failing.
   - This inconsistency may confuse users about where validation should occur.

### Stateful Operations:
There was no state maintained between calls, so dependent steps failed when their prerequisites failed. The system correctly detected unresolved placeholders but did not offer recovery options.

### Error Handling:
Error messages were generally clear:
- Input validation errors gave precise feedback.
- Placeholder resolution errors clearly indicated the source of failure.

However, the inability to bypass or handle rate limiting gracefully is a major issue that affects usability and reliability.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

**Conclusion:**  
The `search_and_fetch` tool shows promise with solid input validation and structured output formatting. However, all test executions failed due to DuckDuckGo rate limiting or proxy restrictions, which severely impacts functionality.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Use Authenticated DuckDuckGo API**
   - Replace the current unauthenticated scraping approach with the official DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API using an API key to avoid rate limits.

2. **Improve Proxy/Fallback Handling**
   - Implement fallback mechanisms or use alternative proxies if rate limiting is encountered.

3. **Enhance Input Validation**
   - Ensure all invalid types are caught at the function boundary before reaching external APIs.

4. **Add Retry Logic**
   - Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient failures like rate limits.

5. **Document Rate Limit Behavior**
   - Clearly communicate expected limitations to end users when using the unauthenticated version.
