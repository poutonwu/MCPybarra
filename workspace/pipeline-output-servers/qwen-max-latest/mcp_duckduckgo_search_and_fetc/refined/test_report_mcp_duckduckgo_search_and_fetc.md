## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `search_and_fetch`

#### Step ID: `search_happy_path`
- **Step:** Happy path: Basic search with a typical query to test successful execution and return of results.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "AI research"}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: Search failed due to rate limiting. Consider using an API key for unrestricted access.

---

#### Step ID: `search_with_custom_num_results`
- **Step:** Dependent call: Test custom number of results. Uses a different query and limits to 3 results.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "climate change news", "num_results": 3}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: Search failed due to rate limiting. Consider using an API key for unrestricted access.

---

#### Step ID: `search_empty_query`
- **Step:** Edge case: Test server behavior when an empty query is provided. Expected to raise an error.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": ""}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: Query must be a non-empty string.

---

#### Step ID: `search_invalid_num_results`
- **Step:** Edge case: Test handling of invalid num_results (negative integer). Should raise validation error.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "technology trends", "num_results": -2}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: num_results must be a positive integer.

---

#### Step ID: `search_zero_num_results`
- **Step:** Edge case: Test handling of zero as num_results. Should raise validation error.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "latest science discoveries", "num_results": 0}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: num_results must be a positive integer.

---

#### Step ID: `search_non_string_query`
- **Step:** Edge case: Test handling of non-string query input. Should raise validation error.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": 12345}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: Search failed due to rate limiting. Consider using an API key for unrestricted access.

---

#### Step ID: `search_no_results_returned`
- **Step:** Edge case: Test scenario where search returns no results. Should return an empty list.
- **Tool:** `search_and_fetch`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "thisisaveryuniquenonexistentsearchstringthatshouldreturnnoresults"}`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool `search_and_fetch`: Search failed due to rate limiting. Consider using an API key for unrestricted access.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covers:
- Basic happy-path functionality (`search_happy_path`)
- Custom parameter usage (`search_with_custom_num_results`)
- Input validation edge cases (`empty query`, `non-string query`, `invalid/zero/negative num_results`)
- No-results scenario (`search_no_results_returned`)

The coverage is comprehensive in terms of expected inputs and behaviors. However, all tests were blocked by a systemic issue.

### Identified Issues
All tests failed due to **rate limiting** on DuckDuckGo search calls. This prevented any actual functional testing of the result fetching or text cleaning logic.

Potential causes:
- Use of unauthenticated DuckDuckGo search interface without API key
- Aggressive retry logic not being sufficient under high load or restricted network conditions

Impact:
- Unable to verify whether the server correctly handles:
  - Content extraction from real URLs
  - Text cleaning and normalization
  - Handling of no-result scenarios
  - Proper session retries and timeout behavior

### Stateful Operations
No stateful operations were tested since this tool does not maintain sessions or require prior steps.

### Error Handling
- The server **correctly validates input types and values**, raising appropriate errors for:
  - Empty queries
  - Non-integer queries
  - Invalid `num_results` values
- However, **rate limit errors are not gracefully handled** beyond basic retries. The fallback message suggests using an API key but does not offer alternative mitigation strategies.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's core functionality could not be verified due to persistent rate limiting during testing. While input validation works correctly, the inability to execute searches blocks all downstream functionality.

### Recommendations:
1. **Integrate DuckDuckGo API with authentication** to bypass public scraping limits.
2. **Add configurable retry delay/backoff strategy** that adapts based on observed rate limits.
3. **Implement circuit breaker pattern** to avoid repeated attempts after multiple failures.
4. **Improve logging** to distinguish between initial request failure vs. retry exhaustion.
5. **Consider caching** for frequent or duplicate queries to reduce external requests.
