- **Parameters:** `{"query": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?", "max_results": 3}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Answer returned successfully explaining the difference between lists and tuples.

#### Step: Edge case: Test answer search with an empty query.
- **Tool:** `tavily_answer_search`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": ""}`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `'query' must be a non-empty string.`

---

### Tool: `tavily_news_search`

#### Step: Happy path: Search for recent news articles about AI developments over the last 30 days.
- **Tool:** `tavily_news_search`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "AI developments", "days_back": 30, "max_results": 4}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Retrieved 4 recent news articles about AI development (output truncated due to adapter limitation).

#### Step: Test news search with source filtering.
- **Tool:** `tavily_news_search`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "climate change", "days_back": 14, "include_sources": ["nytimes.com"], "exclude_sources": ["foxnews.com"], "max_results": 2}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Retrieved 2 relevant articles from allowed sources (output truncated due to adapter limitation).

#### Step: Edge case: Test news search with invalid days_back value (zero).
- **Tool:** `tavily_news_search`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "technology trends", "days_back": 0}`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `'days_back' must be between 1 and 365.`

---

### Dependent Calls

#### Step: Use the title of the first result from the basic web search to test data extraction.
- **Tool:** `text.summarize`
- **Parameters:** `{"text": null}`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to `None`, likely due to failure in a dependency (`basic_web_search` did not pass its output properly or was not accessible).

#### Step: Extract content from the first news article for summarization.
- **Tool:** `text.summarize`
- **Parameters:** `{"text": null}`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to `None`.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage:
The main functionalities—web search, answer generation, and news search—were all tested. Domain/source filtering, result limits, and invalid inputs were also included. However, dependent operations (e.g., chaining outputs into subsequent steps) were only partially successful.

### Identified Issues:
1. **Domain Filtering Not Working as Expected**  
   - **Failed Test:** `advanced_web_search_with_filters`  
   - **Expected Behavior:** Should return filtered results from `example.com` excluding `wikipedia.org`.  
   - **Actual Behavior:** Request failed with no clear explanation. Potential issue with unsupported domains or request formatting.

2. **Empty Query Handling in Web Search Fails Gracefully but Correctly**  
   - **Failed Test:** `web_search_invalid_query`  
   - **Expected Behavior:** Should raise error on empty query.  
   - **Actual Behavior:** Raised expected error message, but this indicates missing pre-validation in the UI or calling system.

3. **Dependent Data Extraction Fails Due to Null Inputs**  
   - **Failed Test:** `get_first_web_result_title`, `extract_news_content`  
   - **Expected Behavior:** Should extract data from previous step outputs.  
   - **Actual Behavior:** Parameters resolved to `null`, indicating poor state management or output referencing.

4. **News Search Days Back Validation Works, But Could Be More User-Friendly**  
   - **Failed Test:** `news_search_invalid_days_back`  
   - **Expected Behavior:** Should reject invalid values like 0.  
   - **Actual Behavior:** Correctly rejected it, but could provide more guidance (e.g., suggest valid range).

### Stateful Operations:
Chaining outputs between steps (e.g., using `$outputs.basic_web_search[0].title`) failed when attempting to use them in subsequent steps. This suggests either limitations in the MCP adapter or incorrect usage of placeholder syntax.

### Error Handling:
Error messages are generally clear and helpful (e.g., `'query' must be a non-empty string`). However, in some cases, failures (like the domain filter one) resulted in generic errors without actionable feedback.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server functions largely as intended, especially for standard use cases like basic web search, answer generation, and news retrieval. Input validation works well for most fields. However, there are several areas for improvement:

### Recommendations:
1. **Improve Domain Filter Support**: Investigate why requests with domain filters fail and ensure they are supported by the backend.
2. **Enhance Dependent Step Execution**: Fix or document how outputs from previous steps can be referenced in new steps to enable chaining functionality.
3. **Refine Error Messages for Invalid Values**: For example, when `days_back` is invalid, include a suggestion like “must be between 1 and 365.”
4. **Handle Adapter Truncation Gracefully**: Ensure users understand that truncation is due to adapter limits and not actual tool behavior.
