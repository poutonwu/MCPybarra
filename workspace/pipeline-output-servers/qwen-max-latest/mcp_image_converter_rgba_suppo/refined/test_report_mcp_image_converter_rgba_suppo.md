  - Successful Tests: 4
  - Failed Tests: 3

---

## 2. Test Environment

- **Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution
- **MCP Server Tools:**
  - `convert_image`

---

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### ✅ Happy Path Conversion

- **Step:** Convert a JPEG image to PNG format and save it in the output directory.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nature.jpeg",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\converted_images",
    "output_format": "PNG"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Image successfully converted and saved to output path.

---

### ❌ Dependent Output Check

- **Step:** Use the output file path from the previous conversion step as input for another conversion to GIF format.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "Image successfully converted and saved to D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\converted_images\\converted_image.png",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\reconverted_images",
    "output_format": "GIF"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Input file does not exist error. The input parameter was incorrectly derived from the full message instead of just the file path.

---

### ❌ Unsupported Format Test

- **Step:** Attempt to convert an image to an unsupported format (TIFF) to verify error handling.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nature.jpeg",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\invalid_format",
    "output_format": "TIFF"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success (as expected failure)
- **Result:** Correctly failed with "Unsupported output format: TIFF".

---

### ❌ Nonexistent Input File

- **Step:** Try converting a non-existent input file to test error response.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nonexistent.png",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\error_cases",
    "output_format": "JPEG"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success (as expected failure)
- **Result:** Correctly failed with "Input file does not exist" error.

---

### ✅ Transparent RGBA Conversion

- **Step:** Convert an RGBA image to JPEG, which should trigger automatic RGB conversion.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\app.ico",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\rgba_conversion",
    "output_format": "JPEG"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully converted and saved as JPEG without errors, indicating correct handling of RGBA to RGB conversion.

---

### ❌ Empty Output Path

- **Step:** Provide an empty output path to test how the server handles invalid paths.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\xue.jpg",
    "output_path": "",
    "output_format": "PNG"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error occurred: `[WinError 3] 系统找不到指定的路径。: ''` — indicates failure to handle empty output path gracefully.

---

### ❌ Special Characters in Paths

- **Step:** Test with special characters in both input and output paths.
- **Tool:** convert_image
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "input_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\extract_@#$.pdf",
    "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testOutput\\!@#$%&()",
    "output_format": "BMP"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error occurred: `cannot identify image file '...'` — likely due to incorrect file type rather than special characters.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

- All core functionalities were tested:
  - Basic image conversion
  - Handling of RGBA → RGB conversion
  - Invalid inputs (nonexistent file, unsupported format, empty output)
  - Special character support in paths
  - Chaining outputs from one call to another

### Identified Issues

1. **Incorrect Parameter Substitution in Dependent Call**  
   - Step ID: `dependent_output_check`
   - Problematic Tool: `convert_image`
   - Description: Used the entire success message (`"Image successfully converted..."`) as the `input_path`, instead of extracting only the file path.
   - Expected Behavior: Should extract only the file path from the previous result.
   - Actual Behavior: Caused an "Input file does not exist" error.

2. **Empty Output Path Not Handled Gracefully**  
   - Step ID: `empty_output_path`
   - Problematic Tool: `convert_image`
   - Description: When provided with an empty output path, the server raised a Windows system error instead of returning a clear user-facing error.
   - Expected Behavior: Return a structured error like `"message": "Output path cannot be empty."`
   - Actual Behavior: Raised `[WinError 3] 系统找不到指定的路径。: ''`

3. **Special Characters in Input Path Caused Misidentification**  
   - Step ID: `special_chars_in_paths`
   - Problematic Tool: `convert_image`
   - Description: Tried to open a `.pdf` file as an image, causing an error. While this is technically not a bug, the server could validate that the input file is actually an image before attempting to process it.
   - Expected Behavior: Validate file type before processing.
   - Actual Behavior: Raised an unhelpful error about being unable to identify the image file.

### Stateful Operations

- The dependent operation test failed because of incorrect parsing of prior results. This highlights a flaw in how the test framework or adapter handled chaining outputs between steps.

### Error Handling

- The server generally returns meaningful error messages for known failure cases (e.g., unsupported format, missing files).
- However, some edge cases (like empty output path) resulted in raw OS-level errors instead of user-friendly responses.
- There is room for improvement in validating input types (e.g., ensuring the input is indeed an image file).

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The `image_converter` server performs its primary function well, with most image conversions succeeding and proper handling of common errors. However, there are areas for improvement:

### ✅ Strengths:
- Handles RGBA to RGB conversion correctly.
- Supports multiple image formats.
- Returns structured JSON error messages for many failure scenarios.

### 🔧 Recommendations:
1. **Improve Input Validation**  
   - Add checks to ensure the input file is a valid image file before attempting to open it.
   - Handle empty or invalid paths more gracefully by returning structured errors.

2. **Fix Output Chaining Logic**  
   - Ensure that dependent steps only use the actual output file path from previous results, not the entire success message.

3. **Enhance Error Messages**  
   - Replace generic OS-level errors (e.g., WinError 3) with descriptive, user-friendly messages.

4. **Log Truncation Note**  
   - Some log entries may appear incomplete due to MCP adapter limitations, but these do not reflect on the actual behavior of the tool itself.
