It is designed for integration into an MCP (Model Communication Protocol) system to enable LLMs or agents to programmatically access and manipulate relational databases.

**Overall Result:** Critical failures identified  
**Key Statistics:**
- Total Tests Executed: 9
- Successful Tests: 1
- Failed Tests: 8

---

## 2. Test Environment

**Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution  
**MCP Server Tools:**
- `list_resources`

---

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### ✅ list_resources - List all available tables in the database

- **Step:** Happy path: List all available tables in the database to verify basic connectivity.

- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully returned list of tables: `["addresses", "companies", "order_items", "orders", "products", "reviews", "users"]`

---

### ❌ read_resource - Read data from the first table

- **Step:** Dependent call (list access): Read data from the first table returned by list_resources.
- **Tool:** `read_resource`
- **Parameters:** `{"table_name": "addresses"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ execute_sql - SELECT query on first table

- **Step:** Execute a SELECT SQL query on the same table used in read_resource to validate consistency of results.
- **Tool:** `execute_sql`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "SELECT * FROM `addresses` LIMIT 10"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ execute_sql - Query on non-existent table

- **Step:** Edge case: Execute a query on a non-existent table to test error handling.
- **Tool:** `execute_sql`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "SELECT * FROM `non_existent_table`"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ execute_sql - UPDATE operation

- **Step:** Execute an UPDATE statement to test write operations and affected rows reporting.
- **Tool:** `execute_sql`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "UPDATE `addresses` SET name = 'TestUser' WHERE id = 1"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ execute_sql - Verify update result

- **Step:** Verify that the update operation was successful by re-querying the updated row.
- **Tool:** `execute_sql`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "SELECT * FROM `addresses` WHERE id = 1"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ read_resource - Invalid table name

- **Step:** Edge case: Attempt to read from a non-existent table to test error handling.
- **Tool:** `read_resource`
- **Parameters:** `{"table_name": "invalid_table_for_testing"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

---

### ❌ read_resource - Empty table name

- **Step:** Edge case: Test with an empty string as the table name to ensure validation works.
- **Tool:** `read_resource`
- **Parameters:** `{"table_name": ""}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "Invalid table_name provided. Must be a non-empty string."`

---

### ❌ execute_sql - Invalid SQL syntax

- **Step:** Edge case: Test SQL execution with invalid syntax to verify error handling.
- **Tool:** `execute_sql`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "SELCT * FORM `addresses`"}`  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** `"error": "2017 (HY000): Can't open named pipe to host: .  pipe: MySQL (2)"`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan covers:
- Listing resources (`list_resources`)
- Reading resource content (`read_resource`)
- Executing custom SQL queries (`execute_sql`) including both read and write operations
- Error handling for edge cases such as invalid table names, invalid SQL syntax, and empty input

The coverage appears comprehensive for the core functionality.

---

### Identified Issues

1. **Persistent Connection Failures**
   - All failed tests show the same error: `"Can't open named pipe to host: . pipe: MySQL (2)"`
   - This indicates a systemic issue with establishing or maintaining database connections.
   - Likely causes:
     - Misconfigured environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME)
     - Network issues preventing connection to the database
     - Named pipe misconfiguration on the system

2. **Error Handling Inconsistencies**
   - Some errors (like empty table name) are caught and handled correctly with meaningful messages.
   - Others (like invalid SQL syntax) fail silently due to the underlying connection issue rather than proper SQL parsing and validation.

---

### Stateful Operations

- Several steps depend on previous outputs (e.g., using the first table name from `list_resources`).
- However, since all dependent calls fail due to the same connection issue, stateful behavior could not be validated.

---

### Error Handling

- Input validation works correctly in some cases (e.g., empty string for `table_name`).
- However, many failures simply return generic connection errors instead of more specific validation or SQL parsing errors.
- Better error categorization would improve usability and debugging.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's logic appears correct based on its implementation and tool descriptions. However, **all but one test failed due to a persistent database connection issue**, which prevents full validation of the server’s intended functionality.

### Recommendations:

1. **Fix Database Configuration**
   - Ensure all required environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) are properly set before running the server.
   - Validate database accessibility externally before testing the server.

2. **Improve Connection Handling**
   - Add robust retry logic or clearer connection failure diagnostics.
   - Consider adding a health check endpoint/tool.

3. **Enhance Error Differentiation**
   - Distinguish between connection errors, query syntax errors, and invalid inputs in error messages.
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes or structured error types if applicable.

4. **Add Logging**
   - Implement detailed logging to capture exact failure points during execution.

5. **Input Sanitization**
   - Add SQL injection prevention mechanisms when using the `execute_sql` tool.
