## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Company Profile

#### Step: Happy path: Retrieve company profile for a valid stock code (NVIDIA).
- **Tool:** get_company_profile
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool get_company_profile: HTTP error occurred: 404 - [HTML Not Found]

---

### Dependent Data Retrieval (Fails Due to Dependency)

All dependent calls failed because the initial `get_company_profile` call failed, leading to unresolved placeholders.

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| get_income_statements | Fetch income statements using the ticker from the previous step with valid parameters. | ❌ Failure |
| get_balance_sheets | Fetch balance sheets using the same ticker and valid inputs. | ❌ Failure |
| get_cash_flows | Get cash flow data for the same company. | ❌ Failure |
| get_earnings_history | Retrieve earnings history for the company. | ❌ Failure |
| get_analyst_estimates | Get analyst estimates like target prices. | ❌ Failure |
| get_financial_ratios | Retrieve key financial ratios like P/E, D/E. | ❌ Failure |
| get_ownership_data | Fetch ownership structure details. | ❌ Failure |
| get_stock_prices | Query historical stock prices within a valid date range. | ❌ Failure |
| get_market_news | Fetch latest news articles related to the company. | ❌ Failure |
| get_dividend_history | Retrieve dividend history if available. | ❌ Failure |
| get_splits_history | Get stock splits history for the company. | ❌ Failure |

Each of these steps resulted in:
> A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency.

### Edge Case Testing

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when an invalid stock code is provided.
- **Tool:** get_company_profile
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "INVALIDCODE"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool get_company_profile: HTTP error occurred: 404 - [HTML Not Found]

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to fetch income statements with unsupported report period.
- **Tool:** get_income_statements
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA", "report_period": "monthly", "limit": 5}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Unexpected error fetching income statements: 'report_period' must be one of: annual, quarterly, ttm.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Use zero limit to test input validation.
- **Tool:** get_balance_sheets
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA", "report_period": "annual", "limit": 0}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Unexpected error fetching balance sheets: 'limit' must be a positive integer.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Pass negative limit value to check error handling.
- **Tool:** get_cash_flows
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA", "report_period": "quarterly", "limit": -3}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Unexpected error fetching cash flows: 'limit' must be a positive integer.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Request future stock price data (expect no results or proper error).
- **Tool:** get_stock_prices
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA", "start_date": "2099-01-01", "end_date": "2099-12-31"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** HTTP error occurred: 404 - [HTML Not Found]

---

#### Step: Edge case: Use incorrect date format to test input validation.
- **Tool:** get_stock_prices
- **Parameters:** {"stock_code": "NVDA", "start_date": "2023/01/01", "end_date": "2023/12/31"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Unexpected error fetching stock prices: 'start_date' and 'end_date' must be in format YYYY-MM-DD.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Call get_market_news with empty company name to trigger validation error.
- **Tool:** get_market_news
- **Parameters:** {"company_name": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Unexpected error fetching market news: 'company_name' must be a non-empty string.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan aimed to cover all major functionalities of the financial data processor, including core financial statements, stock prices, analyst estimates, and market news. However, most tests could not execute fully due to early failures.

### Identified Issues

1. **API Endpoint Accessibility Issue**
   - All requests to `/company-profile`, `/income-statements`, etc., returned 404 errors.
   - Likely cause: The FinancialDatasets API endpoints have changed or are unreachable.
   - Impact: Entire functionality chain fails since subsequent tools depend on successful retrieval of company ticker/name.

2. **Input Validation Works Correctly**
   - Tools correctly validated unsupported values (`report_period=monthly`), null strings (`company_name=""`), and incorrect date formats.
   - This shows robust error handling at the tool level.

3. **Dependent Execution Fails Gracefully but Informs Poorly**
   - When a dependency fails (e.g., `get_company_profile`), downstream steps fail due to missing placeholder values.
   - While this behavior is expected, clearer diagnostic messages about the root cause would improve debugging.

### Stateful Operations
- The system attempted to pass outputs between tools (e.g., ticker from `get_company_profile` used in `get_income_statements`), but since the first step failed, none of the dependent steps succeeded.

### Error Handling
- Input validation was handled well—invalid inputs were caught and meaningful exceptions raised.
- However, external API errors (e.g., 404) were not masked or gracefully handled beyond propagating the exception.
- No retry logic or fallback mechanisms were observed.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The server's tool implementation is functionally sound in terms of input validation and internal logic, but it failed comprehensively due to inaccessible external APIs. This suggests that while the Python code is correct, integration with the backend service is broken or outdated.

### Recommendations
1. **Verify API Endpoints**: Confirm that the FinancialDatasets API base URL and endpoint paths are still valid and reachable.
2. **Improve Root Cause Diagnostics**: Enhance logging or error propagation to clearly identify root causes of failures in dependent chains.
3. **Add Retries and Circuit Breakers**: For external API calls, implement retry logic and circuit breaker patterns to handle transient network issues.
4. **Mock External Services for Testing**: Consider mocking external services during testing to isolate logic correctness from infrastructure availability.
5. **Update Documentation**: Reflect any changes in API paths or authentication requirements in documentation and environment setup instructions.
