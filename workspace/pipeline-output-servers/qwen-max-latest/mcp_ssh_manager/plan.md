### MCP Tools Plan

#### Tool: `connect`
- **Description**: Establishes an SSH connection to a remote server using either password or key-based authentication. Automatically manages the session.
- **Parameters**:
  - `host` (str): The hostname or IP address of the remote server.
  - `port` (int): The port number for the SSH connection (default is 22).
  - `username` (str): The username for authentication.
  - `password` (str, optional): The password for password-based authentication.
  - `key_path` (str, optional): The path to the private key file for key-based authentication.
- **Return Value**: A unique session identifier (str) representing the established SSH session.

#### Tool: `disconnect`
- **Description**: Disconnects a specified SSH session and releases associated resources.
- **Parameters**:
  - `session_id` (str): The unique identifier of the SSH session to disconnect.
- **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the disconnection was successful.

#### Tool: `list_sessions`
- **Description**: Lists all currently active SSH sessions managed by the server.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Return Value**: A list of dictionaries, each containing details about an active session such as `session_id`, `host`, `port`, `username`.

#### Tool: `execute`
- **Description**: Executes a command on a specified SSH session with options for standard input and timeout settings. Returns standard output, error output, and exit status.
- **Parameters**:
  - `session_id` (str): The unique identifier of the SSH session.
  - `command` (str): The command to execute on the remote server.
  - `stdin` (str, optional): Standard input to pass to the command.
  - `timeout` (int, optional): Timeout in seconds for the command execution.
- **Return Value**: A dictionary containing `stdout` (str), `stderr` (str), and `exit_status` (int).

#### Tool: `upload`
- **Description**: Uploads a local file to a specified path on the remote SSH server.
- **Parameters**:
  - `session_id` (str): The unique identifier of the SSH session.
  - `local_path` (str): The path to the local file to upload.
  - `remote_path` (str): The destination path on the remote server.
- **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the upload was successful.

#### Tool: `download`
- **Description**: Downloads a file from the remote SSH server to a specified local path.
- **Parameters**:
  - `session_id` (str): The unique identifier of the SSH session.
  - `remote_path` (str): The path to the file on the remote server.
  - `local_path` (str): The destination path on the local machine.
- **Return Value**: A boolean indicating whether the download was successful.

### Server Overview
The purpose of this MCP server is to provide automated SSH remote management capabilities. It supports establishing and managing SSH connections, executing remote commands, and transferring files between the local machine and remote servers. All functionalities are accessible through well-defined tools that adhere to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### File to be Generated
- **Filename**: `mcp_ssh_server.py`

### Dependencies
- `paramiko`: A Python library for SSH protocol implementation, which will handle the underlying SSH connection logic including authentication, command execution, and file transfers.
