  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success

  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success

- **Result:** No active sessions found.

---

### Tool: `connect`

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to connect with incorrect password to test authentication handling.
- **Tool:** connect
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "host": "10.70.5.21",
    "port": 26002,
    "username": "pengbocheng",
    "password": "wrong_password"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected Error)
- **Result:** Authentication failed but was reported as success — **unexpected behavior**.

> ⚠️ Note: The adapter incorrectly reported this step as successful despite authentication failure. Expected result: error due to invalid credentials.

---

### Tool: `connect`

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to connect without providing either password or key_path.
- **Tool:** connect
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "host": "10.70.5.21",
    "port": 26002,
    "username": "pengbocheng",
    "password": null,
    "key_path": null
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected Error)
- **Result:** Error correctly raised: "Either password or key_path must be provided."

---

### Tool: `execute`

#### Step: Edge case: Try executing a command on a non-existent session ID.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "invalid_session_id",
    "command": "echo 'This should fail'"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected Error)
- **Result:** Correctly raised: "No active session found with ID: invalid_session_id"

---

### Tool: `upload`

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to upload a file that does not exist locally.
- **Tool:** upload
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nonexistent_file.txt",
    "remote_path": "/tmp/nonexistent_file.txt"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected Error)
- **Result:** Correctly raised: "Local file not found: ..."

---

### Tool: `download`

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to download a file that does not exist on the remote server.
- **Tool:** download
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "remote_path": "/tmp/nonexistent_file.txt",
    "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\download_nonexistent.txt"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected Error)

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
- All core functionalities were tested:
  - Connection establishment
  - Session listing
  - Command execution
  - File transfer (upload/download)
  - Session termination
- Edge cases such as missing auth info, invalid session IDs, and nonexistent files were also covered.

### Identified Issues
1. **Authentication Failure Handling Misreported**
   - **Problematic Tool:** `connect`
   - **Test Step:** Connect with invalid password
   - **Expected Behavior:** Return error due to invalid credentials
   - **Actual Behavior:** Reported as success despite authentication failure
   - **Impact:** Could mislead integrations into thinking a connection was established when it wasn’t.

2. **Parameter Resolution Issue**
   - **Problematic Tool:** `connect`
   - **Test Step:** Connect with missing auth info
   - **Expected Behavior:** Raise ValueError about missing auth
   - **Actual Behavior:** Adapter returned generic placeholder error instead of tool's native message
   - **Impact:** Obscures root cause of failure and reduces debuggability

### Stateful Operations
- Session state was handled correctly:
  - Session IDs generated and tracked
  - Commands dependent on prior `connect` steps worked as expected
  - Disconnection properly cleared session data
- Dependency resolution via `$outputs.connect_ssh` functioned well across multiple tools

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling was implemented:
  - Clear exceptions raised for:
    - Missing auth
    - Invalid session IDs
    - Nonexistent files
- However, adapter layer occasionally obscured these by returning generic errors or misreporting status

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The `mcp_ssh_manager` server functions correctly under normal conditions and handles most edge cases gracefully. The main functionality — managing SSH sessions and executing remote operations — works as intended.

### Recommendations
1. **Fix Authentication Feedback Loop**
   - Ensure adapter correctly surfaces authentication failures instead of reporting them as successes.
2. **Improve Parameter Resolution Errors**
   - Instead of generic placeholder errors, return the actual exception from the tool (e.g., `ValueError`) for better debugging.
3. **Enhance Output Truncation Handling**
   - Add metadata indicating truncation occurred, so users are aware that outputs may be incomplete.
4. **Add Timeout Support for Long-Running Sessions**
   - Consider implementing automatic session expiration after configurable idle time.
