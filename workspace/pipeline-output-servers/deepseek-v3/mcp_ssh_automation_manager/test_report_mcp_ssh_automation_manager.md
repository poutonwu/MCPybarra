---

#### Step: Dependent call: Disconnect the established SSH session.
- **Tool:** disconnect
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1"
  }
  ```

- **Result:** Session successfully terminated.

---

#### Step: Dependent call: Ensure the disconnected session no longer appears in active sessions.
- **Tool:** list_sessions
- **Parameters:** `{}` (no parameters required)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** No sessions were listed ‚Äî correct behavior post-disconnect.

---

### üíª Command Execution

#### Step: Dependent call: Execute a simple echo command on the connected SSH session.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "command": "echo 'Hello from SSH'"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** Command executed successfully; output: `"Hello from SSH"`.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Try executing a command on a non-existent session ID.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** 
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "invalid_session_id",
    "command": "echo 'This should not run'"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error: `"Session invalid_session_id not found."` ‚Äî handled correctly.

---

### üì§ File Transfer (Upload)

#### Step: Dependent call: Upload a local file to the remote server.

  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\sample1.pdf",
    "remote_path": "/tmp/sample1.pdf"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Result:** File uploaded successfully.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to upload a local file that does not exist.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all major functionalities:
- SSH connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect/list)
- Remote command execution
- File transfer (upload/download)
- Error handling for common failure scenarios

### Identified Issues

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| üîê Silent Auth Failure | Connect tool accepted wrong password without raising an error. Could lead to undetected access issues. |

### Stateful Operations
- Session state was managed correctly.
- Session IDs were passed between steps and used appropriately.
- Disconnection cleanly removed sessions from tracking.

### Error Handling
- Most errors were caught and reported clearly.
- Missing files, invalid sessions, and malformed input were handled gracefully.
- **Exception:** Invalid password did not raise an explicit authentication error.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The SSH automation manager demonstrated strong stability and correctness across most operations. All core functions worked as expected, and error handling was robust for most failure modes.

### Recommendations
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Improve Authentication Failure Detection**: Return clear error when password is incorrect instead of silently accepting it.
2. üìù **Enhance Tool Documentation**: Clarify how authentication failures are detected and reported.
3. üß™ **Add More Negative Tests**: Include additional test cases for partial credentials, expired keys, etc.
