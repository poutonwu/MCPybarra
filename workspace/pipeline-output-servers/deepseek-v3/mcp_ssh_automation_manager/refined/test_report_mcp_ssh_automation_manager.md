### üî¥ Attempt Disconnect Invalid Session

- **Step:** Attempt to disconnect a non-existent session to test error handling.
- **Tool:** `disconnect`
- **Parameters:**  
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "invalid_session_id"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error: `'Session invalid_session_id not found.'`

---

### üî¥ Execute on Disconnected Session

- **Step:** Try executing a command on a disconnected session to validate error handling.
- **Tool:** `execute`
- **Parameters:**  
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "command": "ls -l /tmp"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error: `'Session session_1 not found.'`

---

### üî¥ Upload Nonexistent Local File

- **Step:** Attempt to upload a local file that does not exist to check error handling.
- **Tool:** `upload`
- **Parameters:**  
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "session_1",
    "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\nonexistent_file.txt",
    "remote_path": "/tmp/nonexistent_file.txt"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error: `'Session session_1 not found.'`  
  *(Note: The actual issue was session already closed, not file not found)*

---

### üî¥ Connect Using Private Key

- **Step:** Connect using private key authentication instead of password.
- **Tool:** `connect`
- **Parameters:**  
  ```json
  {
    "hostname": "10.70.5.21",
    "username": "pengbocheng",
    "private_key": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\private_key.pem"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** Error: `'Private key file not found'`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

All major functionalities were tested:
- Connection establishment
- Session listing
- Command execution
- File upload/download
- Session termination
- Edge case handling

The test plan appears comprehensive, covering both happy paths and edge cases.

---

### Identified Issues

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Attempting to use a disconnected session resulted in errors (`execute`, `upload`) |
| 2 | Missing private key file caused failure during alternative authentication path |
| 3 | Attempting to disconnect an invalid session returned a clear but expected error |

---

### Stateful Operations

Stateful operations worked correctly for valid flows:
- `connect` ‚Üí `execute` ‚Üí `upload` ‚Üí `download` ‚Üí `disconnect` sequence succeeded
- `session_id` was properly passed between dependent steps
- However, no automatic session state validation occurred after disconnection, leading to errors when reused

---

### Error Handling

- Errors were clearly reported with meaningful messages
- Proper exceptions raised (`KeyError`, `FileNotFoundError`, etc.)
- No silent failures observed
- Could be improved by validating session status before executing dependent actions

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The `mcp_ssh_automation_manager` server functions correctly under normal conditions. It supports SSH connection management, command execution, and secure file transfers. Error handling is robust, and tool outputs are informative.

However, edge cases involving invalid or expired sessions revealed potential issues in state management.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Session Validation**  
   Add automatic checks before each operation to ensure the session is still active.

2. **Improve Session Cleanup Tracking**  
   Mark sessions as inactive immediately upon disconnection rather than removing them from memory instantly.

3. **Add Tool-Level Input Validation**  
   For tools like `upload`, pre-check if the file exists before attempting to use an SSH session.

4. **Support Session Reuse or Auto-Reconnect**  
   Allow users to re-establish sessions automatically if they attempt to reuse a closed one.

5. **Improve Documentation for Private Key Usage**  
   Clarify expected format and location of private keys used for authentication.
