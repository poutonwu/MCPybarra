1. **MCP Tools Plan**

   * **Function Name**: `get_text_file_contents`
     * **Description**: Reads the contents of multiple text files, optionally by line range, and returns the file contents along with a hash value for concurrency control.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_paths` (List[str]): Paths to the text files to read.
       * `line_range` (Tuple[int, int], optional): The start and end line numbers to read (inclusive). If not provided, reads the entire file.
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary where keys are file paths and values are dictionaries containing:
       * `content` (str): The content of the file or the specified line range.
       * `hash` (str): A hash value of the file content for concurrency control.

   * **Function Name**: `create_text_file`
     * **Description**: Creates a new text file with the specified content.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_path` (str): The path where the new text file will be created.
       * `content` (str): The content to write to the new file.
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary with:
       * `success` (bool): Indicates whether the file was created successfully.
       * `message` (str): A status message (e.g., "File created successfully" or an error message).

   * **Function Name**: `append_text_file_contents`
     * **Description**: Appends content to an existing text file.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_path` (str): The path to the text file.
       * `content` (str): The content to append to the file.
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary with:
       * `success` (bool): Indicates whether the content was appended successfully.
       * `message` (str): A status message.

   * **Function Name**: `delete_text_file_contents`
     * **Description**: Deletes a specific range of lines from a text file.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_path` (str): The path to the text file.
       * `line_range` (Tuple[int, int]): The start and end line numbers to delete (inclusive).
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary with:
       * `success` (bool): Indicates whether the lines were deleted successfully.
       * `message` (str): A status message.

   * **Function Name**: `insert_text_file_contents`
     * **Description**: Inserts content into a text file at a specified line position.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_path` (str): The path to the text file.
       * `line_number` (int): The line number where the content will be inserted.
       * `content` (str): The content to insert.
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary with:
       * `success` (bool): Indicates whether the content was inserted successfully.
       * `message` (str): A status message.

   * **Function Name**: `patch_text_file_contents`
     * **Description**: Applies precise modifications to a text file, with hash validation to avoid conflicts.
     * **Parameters**:
       * `file_path` (str): The path to the text file.
       * `modifications` (List[Dict]): A list of modifications, where each modification is a dictionary with:
         * `action` (str): The action to perform (e.g., "insert", "delete", "replace").
         * `line_number` (int): The line number to modify.
         * `content` (str, optional): The content to insert or replace (if applicable).
       * `expected_hash` (str): The expected hash value of the file content before modifications.
     * **Return Value**: A dictionary with:
       * `success` (bool): Indicates whether the modifications were applied successfully.
       * `message` (str): A status message.
       * `new_hash` (str): The new hash value of the file content after modifications.

2. **Server Overview**

   The server is designed to automate text file processing, providing functionalities to read, create, append, delete, insert, and patch text files. It supports concurrency control via hash validation to prevent conflicts during concurrent modifications.

3. **File to be Generated**

   * `mcp_text_file_server.py`

4. **Dependencies**

   * `mcp[cli]`: For MCP server implementation.
   * `hashlib`: For generating file content hashes.
