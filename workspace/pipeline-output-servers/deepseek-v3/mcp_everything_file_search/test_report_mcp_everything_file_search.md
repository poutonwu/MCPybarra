## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `search_files`

#### Step: Verify that the everything.dll is loaded successfully during server initialization and basic search works.

- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test case-sensitive search by looking for exact case matches of 'README'.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "README", "case_sensitive": true }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test full-word matching by searching for files named exactly 'config' without partial matches.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "config", "full_word": true }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test regex-based search by finding all .log files using a regular expression.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "^.*\\.log$", "regex": true }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test limit parameter by restricting results to 5 entries.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "*", "limit": 5 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Search for files larger than 1MB to test size-based filtering.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "size:>1MB" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test time-based filtering by searching files modified today.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "modified:today" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test sorting functionality by sorting all files by name.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "*", "sort_by": "name" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Edge case: Test behavior when query is an empty string.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Edge case: Search for files with a non-existent extension to test empty result handling.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "*.xyz123" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test invalid sort criteria; should default to no sorting or fail gracefully.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "*", "sort_by": "invalid_field" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Test searching for a specific known file from the provided test files list.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "downloaded_sample1.pdf" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

#### Step: Check if file attributes (readonly, hidden, etc.) are correctly returned for a known file.
- **Tool:** search_files
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "downloaded_sample1.pdf" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `Search failed: function 'Everything_Query' not found`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covers nearly all aspects of the `search_files` tool:
- Basic functionality (`*`)
- File type filtering (`.txt`, `.log`)
- Size filtering (`size:>1MB`)
- Time filtering (`modified:today`)
- Regex support
- Case sensitivity
- Full word matching
- Sorting
- Edge cases (empty query, invalid extensions)

However, due to the underlying issue, none of these features could be validated.

### Identified Issues
**Critical Bug Across All Tests:**
- **Description:** Missing required function `Everything_Query` in the loaded DLL.
- **Impact:** Prevents any search operation from executing, rendering the entire tool unusable.
- **Root Cause:** Likely due to incorrect version of `Everything64.dll`, improper loading, or missing exports in the binary.

### Stateful Operations
No stateful operations were tested due to the foundational failure in DLL initialization.

### Error Handling
Error messages were consistent and descriptive:
- `"function 'Everything_Query' not found"` clearly identifies the root problem.
- The server fails gracefully and does not crash despite repeated invalid attempts.
- Input validation was not reached due to earlier failure point.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's core functionality is entirely unavailable due to a critical dependency issue with `everything.dll`. While the code structure appears robust and well-documented, it cannot proceed past the initial search step.

### Recommendations:
1. **Verify DLL Integrity**: Ensure the correct version of `Everything64.dll` is used and that it includes all required exported functions.
2. **Add Pre-flight Checks**: Enhance `load_everything_dll()` to check for presence of key functions before proceeding.
3. **Improve Logging**: Include more detailed logging at load-time to catch missing symbols early.
4. **Fallback or Mocking Mode**: Consider adding a mock mode or fallback behavior for development/testing without the real DLL.
