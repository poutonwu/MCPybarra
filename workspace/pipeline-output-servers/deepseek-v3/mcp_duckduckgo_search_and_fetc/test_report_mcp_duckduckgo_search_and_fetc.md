## 3. Detailed Test Results

### DuckDuckGo Search Functionality

#### ✅ **Step:** Happy path: Perform a basic search with a general query to validate DuckDuckGo integration.  
**Tool:** duckduckgo_search  
**Parameters:** {"query": "AI technology trends"}  
**Status:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** `{ "results": [] }`  

> _Note:_ While technically successful, an empty result set may indicate either adapter output truncation or no related topics returned by DuckDuckGo for this query.

---

#### ✅ **Step:** Dependent call: Search with a custom number of results (within valid range) to test parameter handling.  
**Tool:** duckduckgo_search  
**Parameters:** {"query": "climate change impact", "max_results": 3}  
**Status:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** `{ "results": [] }`  

> _Note:_ Again, while execution was successful, the empty result list raises concerns about either data availability or potential output limitations imposed by the MCP adapter.

---

#### ❌ **Step:** Edge case: Test server behavior when an empty query is provided, expecting validation error.  
**Tool:** duckduckgo_search  
**Parameters:** {"query": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `Error executing tool duckduckgo_search: Query cannot be empty.`  

> _Expected Behavior:_ Correctly handled. The tool rejected an empty query as expected.

---

#### ❌ **Step:** Edge case: Test server behavior when max_results exceeds allowed limit, expecting validation error.  
**Tool:** duckduckgo_search  
**Parameters:** {"query": "quantum computing", "max_results": 15}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `Error executing tool duckduckgo_search: max_results must be between 1 and 10.`  

> _Expected Behavior:_ Correctly handled. The tool enforced the maximum value constraint.

---

#### ✅ **Step:** Sensitive action preparation: Search for information related to sensitive operations without executing them.  
**Tool:** duckduckgo_search  
**Parameters:** {"query": "how to send email via SMTP"}  
**Status:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** `{ "results": [] }`  

> _Note:_ Execution was successful; however, again no results were returned.

---

### Web Content Fetching Functionality

#### ❌ **Step:** Dependent call: Fetch the content from the first result of the initial search to verify webpage scraping functionality.  
**Tool:** fetch_content  
**Parameters:** {"url": null}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_ai_technology.results[0].url'`  

> _Analysis:_ This failure depends on the prior step (`search_ai_technology`) not returning any results. If that had succeeded with actual URLs, this dependent step might have passed.

---

#### ❌ **Step:** Dependent call: Fetch the second result from the custom-result search to test multiple dependencies and parsing.  
**Tool:** fetch_content  
**Parameters:** {"url": null}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_with_custom_result_count.results[1].url'`  

> _Analysis:_ Similar issue—this step failed because the prior search also returned no results.

---

#### ❌ **Step:** Edge case: Attempt to fetch a URL that does not exist to simulate network failure or invalid input.  
**Tool:** fetch_content  
**Parameters:** {"url": "http://invalid-url-for-testing.com"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `Error executing tool fetch_content: Server error '502 Bad Gateway' for url 'http://invalid-url-for-testing.com'`  

> _Expected Behavior:_ Correctly handled. The tool properly propagated the HTTP error response.

---

#### ❌ **Step:** Edge case: Test server response when an empty URL is passed, expecting validation error.  
**Tool:** fetch_content  
**Parameters:** {"url": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** `Error executing tool fetch_content: URL cannot be empty.`  

> _Expected Behavior:_ Correctly handled. Input validation worked as designed.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan covers all core functionalities:
- Basic search via DuckDuckGo API
- Customization of result count
- Validation of inputs (empty queries, invalid max_results)
- Fetching and cleaning web content
- Handling of edge cases (invalid URLs, empty inputs)

However, there are **critical issues** with the DuckDuckGo search returning empty results consistently, which impacts dependent steps.

### Identified Issues

1. **Empty Search Results**
   - **Problematic Tool:** duckduckgo_search
   - **Failed Test Step:** Multiple steps including "Perform a basic search with a general query"
   - **Expected Behavior:** Return at least one valid search result with title, URL, and snippet
   - **Actual Behavior:** All search calls returned `{ "results": [] }`, causing dependent steps to fail due to missing URLs

2. **Dependent Steps Fail Due to Empty Results**
   - **Problematic Tool:** fetch_content
   - **Failed Test Step:** "Fetch the content from the first result" and "Fetch the second result from the custom-result search"
   - **Expected Behavior:** Use URLs from previous search results to fetch and parse page content
   - **Actual Behavior:** Parameters could not be resolved due to missing URLs from prior steps

### Stateful Operations

Stateful operations were tested through parameter substitution using outputs from prior steps. These substitutions worked correctly when values existed, but failed when the source step did not produce usable output (e.g., empty search results).

### Error Handling

The server demonstrated strong error handling:
- Proper validation of inputs (empty query, invalid max_results, empty URL)
- Clear error messages indicating the exact issue
- Propagation of HTTP errors from external services

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server shows robust implementation of input validation and error handling, but suffers from a critical functional flaw: the DuckDuckGo search returns no results consistently, breaking dependent workflows.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate DuckDuckGo API Integration:** Ensure the API request format is correct and the endpoint is functioning as expected.
2. **Improve Debugging Output:** Add intermediate logging to understand why no results are being returned.
3. **Enhance Fallback Logic:** In cases where no results are found, consider returning clearer feedback or alternative responses.
4. **Mock Responses for Testing:** Consider mocking search results during testing to ensure dependent tools can be validated independently.
