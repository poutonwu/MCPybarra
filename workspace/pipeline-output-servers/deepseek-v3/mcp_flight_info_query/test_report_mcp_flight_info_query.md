## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Search Flights Functionality

#### Step: Happy path: Search for one-way flights from London (LHR) to New York (JFK).
* **Tool:** search_flights
* **Parameters:** {"departure": "LHR", "destination": "JFK", "date": "2025-10-10"}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: 

#### Step: Happy path: Search for round-trip flights from San Francisco (SFO) to Los Angeles (LAX).
* **Tool:** search_flights
* **Parameters:** {"departure": "SFO", "destination": "LAX", "date": "2025-11-01", "trip_type": "round-trip", "return_date": "2025-11-08"}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: 

#### Step: Edge case: Test error handling when return_date is missing in a round-trip search.
* **Tool:** search_flights
* **Parameters:** {"departure": "CDG", "destination": "DXB", "date": "2025-09-20", "trip_type": "round-trip"}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: return_date is required for round-trip flights

#### Step: Edge case: Test error handling for an invalid trip_type.
* **Tool:** search_flights
* **Parameters:** {"departure": "SYD", "destination": "MEL", "date": "2025-08-15", "trip_type": "invalid-type"}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: Invalid trip_type specified

### Get Offer Details Functionality

#### Step: Dependent call: Get details of the first flight offer returned by search_one_way_flights.
* **Tool:** get_offer_details
* **Parameters:** {"offer_id": null}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_one_way_flights[0].offer_id'

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to retrieve details for a non-existent offer ID.
* **Tool:** get_offer_details
* **Parameters:** {"offer_id": "invalid-offer-id"}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool get_offer_details: Failed to get offer details: 

### Multi-City Search Functionality

#### Step: Happy path: Search for a multi-city trip with three segments.
* **Tool:** search_multi_city
* **Parameters:** {"segments": [{"departure": "AMS", "destination": "FRA", "date": "2025-12-01"}, {"departure": "FRA", "destination": "IST", "date": "2025-12-05"}, {"departure": "IST", "destination": "AMS", "date": "2025-12-10"}]}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: 

#### Step: Edge case: Test error handling when no segments are provided for multi-city search.
* **Tool:** search_multi_city
* **Parameters:** {"segments": []}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: At least one segment is required

#### Step: Edge case: Test error handling when a segment is missing required fields.
* **Tool:** search_multi_city
* **Parameters:** {"segments": [{"departure": "YYZ"}]}
* **Status:** ❌ Failure
* **Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: Each segment must contain departure, destination, and date

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all major functionalities of the server including:
- One-way flight search
- Round-trip flight search
- Multi-city flight search
- Offer details retrieval
- Error handling for invalid parameters

### Identified Issues
All tests failed with actual API requests failing without specific error messages. Specific issues include:

1. **API Connectivity Problems**: All calls to the Duffel API failed without clear reasons. This could be due to authentication issues, incorrect base URL, or network problems.

2. **Error Handling Inconsistencies**: While some validation errors were correctly handled (e.g., missing return_date, invalid trip_type), the actual API request failures resulted in generic error messages without diagnostics.

3. **Dependency Failures**: The get_offer_details test that depended on search_flights output failed because the prerequisite step didn't return valid data.

### Stateful Operations
No stateful operations were successfully tested as none of the dependent steps succeeded.

### Error Handling
The server demonstrated mixed error handling capabilities:
- Good validation of input parameters (correctly caught missing return_date and invalid trip_type)
- Poor diagnostics for actual API failures (empty error messages)
- Proper handling of empty segments list in multi-city search
- Incomplete handling of segments with missing fields

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server implementation appears complete but has critical connectivity issues preventing functionality. Based on the test results:

**Recommendations:**
1. Investigate and fix the underlying API connectivity issue with the Duffel API
2. Improve error messages to include more diagnostic information when API requests fail
3. Implement better authentication handling for the Duffel API integration
4. Add retry logic for external API calls
5. Validate that the Duffel API token is correctly configured and has proper permissions

The server's design patterns for input validation are sound, but its inability to successfully make any external API calls indicates a critical production-readiness issue that must be addressed.
