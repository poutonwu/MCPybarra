## 3. Detailed Test Results

### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Search Tests

#### Search One-Way Flights (LHR to JFK)
**Step:** Happy path: Search for one-way flights between LHR and JFK on a valid date.  
**Tool:** search_flights  
**Parameters:** {"departure": "LHR", "destination": "JFK", "date": "2025-12-01"}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: 

#### Search Round-Trip Flights (JFK to LAX)
**Step:** Happy path: Search for round-trip flights with valid departure, destination, and return dates.  
**Tool:** search_flights  
**Parameters:** {"departure": "JFK", "destination": "LAX", "date": "2025-12-10", "trip_type": "round-trip", "return_date": "2025-12-17"}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: 

#### Search with Invalid Trip Type
**Step:** Edge case: Test failure when trip_type is not supported.  
**Tool:** search_flights  
**Parameters:** {"departure": "LHR", "destination": "JFK", "date": "2025-12-01", "trip_type": "invalid-trip-type"}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: Invalid trip_type specified

#### Missing Return Date for Round Trip
**Step:** Edge case: Test failure when return_date is missing for round-trip flight search.  
**Tool:** search_flights  
**Parameters:** {"departure": "LHR", "destination": "AMS", "date": "2025-11-20", "trip_type": "round-trip"}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_flights: Failed to search flights: return_date is required for round-trip flights

### üßæ Offer Details Tests

#### Get Details from Previous Search
**Step:** Dependent call: Retrieve detailed information for the first flight offer from previous search results.  
**Tool:** get_offer_details  
**Parameters:** {"offer_id": null}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_one_way_flight[0].id'

#### Invalid Offer ID
**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to get details for an invalid offer ID to test error handling.  
**Tool:** get_offer_details  
**Parameters:** {"offer_id": "invalid-offer-id"}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool get_offer_details: Failed to get offer details: 

### üåç Multi-City Flight Tests

#### Search Multi-City Flights
**Step:** Happy path: Search for multi-city flights with two segments.  
**Tool:** search_multi_city  
**Parameters:** {"segments": [{"departure": "SFO", "destination": "CHI", "date": "2026-01-05"}, {"departure": "CHI", "destination": "NYC", "date": "2026-01-07"}]}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: 

#### Empty Segments in Multi-City Search
**Step:** Edge case: Test failure when no segments are provided for multi-city search.  
**Tool:** search_multi_city  
**Parameters:** {"segments": []}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: At least one segment is required

#### Invalid Segment in Multi-City Search
**Step:** Edge case: Test failure when a segment in multi-city search is missing required fields.  
**Tool:** search_multi_city  
**Parameters:** {"segments": [{"departure": "SYD"}]}  
**Status:** ‚ùå Failure  
**Result:** Error executing tool search_multi_city: Failed to search multi-city flights: Each segment must contain departure, destination, and date

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all three available tools with both happy path and edge case scenarios. However, none of the tests were successful.

### Identified Issues
1. **API Integration Failure:** All direct API calls failed, suggesting potential issues with the Duffel API integration, authentication, or endpoint URLs.
2. **Parameter Validation Issues:** While some error cases were correctly identified (invalid trip type, missing return date), the underlying API calls still failed even for valid parameters.
3. **Dependent Operations Failure:** The attempt to use a flight offer ID from a previous search failed because the initial search didn't return results.
4. **Empty Response Handling:** The server didn't handle empty responses or null inputs gracefully across all tools.

### Stateful Operations
The server couldn't properly handle dependent operations since the initial flight search failed, preventing subsequent operations like getting offer details.

### Error Handling
The server correctly identified some validation errors (invalid trip type, missing segments), but all actual API calls failed with generic errors rather than providing specific diagnostic information. The error messages lacked details about what specifically went wrong in the API request.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server implementation has critical issues that prevent basic functionality from working. All flight search operations failed, which is the core capability of this service.

**Recommendations:**
1. Verify the Duffel API credentials and base URL in the configuration
2. Implement better error handling and reporting in the API client code
3. Add logging to capture request/response details for troubleshooting
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
5. Improve error messages to include status codes and response bodies from failed API requests
6. Consider implementing a mock mode for testing without depending on external APIs
