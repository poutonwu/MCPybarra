**Result:** Validation error - file_paths should be a valid list

#### ❌ Step: Extract first two pages from merged PDF to verify content integrity.
**Tool:** extract_pages  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "source_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\merged_output.pdf",

```json
{
  "target_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\sample1.pdf",
  "directory": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles"
}
```
**Result:** Execution timed out (exceeded 60 seconds)

### Ordered Merge Functionality

#### ❌ Step: Merge PDFs in exact specified order without fuzzy matching.
**Tool:** merge_pdfs_ordered  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "file_paths": ["D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\paper1.pdf", "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\whole_framework.pdf"],
  "order": ["D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\whole_framework.pdf", "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\paper1.pdf"],
  "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\ordered_merge_exact.pdf",
  "fuzzy_match": false
}
```
**Result:** Error: PdfFileMerger is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0.

#### ❌ Step: Merge PDFs using fuzzy match to determine correct file paths.
**Tool:** merge_pdfs_ordered  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "file_paths": ["D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\paper1.pdf", "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\whole_framework.pdf"],
  "order": ["whole_framework", "paper1"],
  "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\ordered_merge_fuzzy.pdf",
  "fuzzy_match": true
}
```
**Result:** Error: PdfFileMerger is deprecated and was removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0.

### Edge Case Testing

#### ❌ Step: Edge case: Test with an invalid directory path.
**Tool:** search_pdfs  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "directory": "invalid_directory_for_test",
  "pattern": "*.pdf"
}
```
**Result:** Error: Directory not found

#### ❌ Step: Edge case: Attempt to merge with empty file list.
**Tool:** merge_pdfs  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "file_paths": [],
  "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\empty_merge_output.pdf"
}
```
**Result:** Error: No PDF files provided for merging

#### ❌ Step: Edge case: Try to extract without specifying any pages.
**Tool:** extract_pages  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "source_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\sample1.pdf",
  "pages": [],
  "output_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\no_page_extraction.pdf"
}
```
**Result:** Error: No pages specified for extraction

#### ❌ Step: Edge case: Use a non-existent target file path.
**Tool:** find_related_pdfs  
**Parameters:**  
```json
{
  "target_path": "non_existent_target.pdf",
  "directory": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles"
}
```
**Result:** Error: Target file not found

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all core functionalities of the server including:
- PDF searching
- Basic PDF merging
- Page extraction
- Ordered merging (both exact and fuzzy matching)
- Finding related PDFs based on content

### Identified Issues
1. **Critical Library Compatibility Issue:** All PDF-related tools use `PdfFileMerger` which has been removed in PyPDF2 3.0.0. This affects merge_pdfs, extract_pages, and merge_pdfs_ordered tools.
2. **Parameter Handling Issue:** The merge_pdfs tool failed when receiving file paths from the search_pdfs output because it expected a list but received a comma-separated string.
3. **Performance Issue:** The find_related_pdfs tool timed out during testing, suggesting potential performance problems with content analysis.

### Stateful Operations
The test attempted to chain operations by using the output of search_pdfs as input to merge_pdfs, but this failed due to improper handling of the output format.

### Error Handling
The server generally provided clear error messages for input validation issues (e.g., empty file lists, invalid directories). However, the errors caused by the deprecated PdfFileMerger class were not handled gracefully and exposed implementation details.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's functionality is significantly impacted by the deprecation of PdfFileMerger in PyPDF2 3.0.0, which breaks the core PDF manipulation capabilities. While the error handling for input validation is adequate, there are critical issues that need to be addressed.

Recommendations:
1. **Update PDF library usage:** Replace all instances of `PdfFileMerger` with `PdfMerger` from PyPDF2 3.0.0 or consider migrating to pypdf which is the actively maintained fork.
2. **Improve parameter handling:** Ensure proper conversion of tool outputs to appropriate input formats when chaining operations.
3. **Optimize find_related_pdfs:** Implement more efficient text comparison algorithms or add progress tracking for long-running operations.
4. **Add timeout handling:** Implement proper timeout handling and reporting for long-running operations.
5. **Enhance documentation:** Clearly document the required versions and dependencies for the PDF libraries used.
