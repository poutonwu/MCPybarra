- **Tool:** list_recent_emails
- **Parameters:** {"days": 7, "folder_name": "NonExistentFolder"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool list_recent_emails: Failed to list recent emails: (-2147352567, '发生意外。', (4096, 'Microsoft Outlook', '尝试的操作失败。找不到某个对象。', None, 0, -2147221233), None)

### Email Search

#### ✅ Search emails containing "meeting"
- **Step:** Happy path: Search for emails containing 'meeting' in subject or sender to verify search capability.
- **Tool:** search_emails
- **Parameters:** {"query": "meeting"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** No output returned (empty result set)

#### ❌ Search project emails with date range
- **Step:** Dependent call: Search for 'project' emails within a specific date range to test filtering.
- **Tool:** search_emails
- **Parameters:** {"query": "project", "start_date": "2024-01-01", "end_date": "2025-12-31"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_emails: Failed to search emails: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

#### ❌ Empty search query
- **Step:** Edge case: Test search with empty query to ensure validation works correctly.
- **Tool:** search_emails
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool search_emails: Failed to search emails: Query cannot be empty

### Email Access & Actions

#### ❌ Retrieve first email details
- **Step:** Dependent call: Retrieve full details of the first email from the previously listed emails to test cache access.
- **Tool:** get_email_by_number
- **Parameters:** {"email_number": 0}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool get_email_by_number: Failed to get email by number: Invalid email number

#### ❌ Reply to first email
- **Step:** Sensitive action: Test replying to the first email in the list with a canned response.
- **Tool:** reply_to_email_by_number
- **Parameters:** {"email_number": 0, "reply_text": "This is an automated reply. I've received your message and will get back to you shortly."}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool reply_to_email_by_number: Failed to reply to email: Invalid email number

### ✅ Compose New Email

#### ✅ Send test email
- **Step:** Sensitive action: Send a new email to validate compose and send functionality.
- **Tool:** compose_email
- **Parameters:** {"subject": "Test Email from MCP Server", "body": "This is a test email sent via the MCP server integration.", "recipients": ["test@example.com"]}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Email sent successfully

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered most core functionalities:
- Folder listing works correctly
- Basic email search functions
- Email composition and sending works
- Missing tests for attachment handling and complex email operations

### Identified Issues
1. **Datetime Comparison Issue**: Both `list_recent_emails` and `search_emails` fail when comparing datetime values due to mixing timezone-aware and naive datetime objects.
2. **Email Caching Failure**: The cache remains empty after failed `list_recent_emails` calls, causing dependent operations like `get_email_by_number` and `reply_to_email_by_number` to fail.
3. **Folder Validation Missing**: The system doesn't validate folder existence before attempting to access it.

### Stateful Operations
The server's stateful operations relying on email caching failed consistently because the initial email listing operation failed, leaving the cache empty for subsequent steps.

### Error Handling
- Generally good explicit validation (e.g., empty search query check)
- Clear error messages for some cases (e.g., empty search query)
- Poor error handling for datetime operations and invalid email indices
- Outlook-specific COM errors are exposed directly rather than being wrapped in user-friendly messages

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server shows partial functionality but has critical issues that prevent reliable use. The core issue appears to be with datetime handling and the caching mechanism between related operations.

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix datetime comparison by ensuring consistent timezone-aware datetime objects throughout
2. Improve email caching to handle failure scenarios more gracefully
3. Add folder existence validation before attempting to access folders
4. Enhance error handling for COM exceptions from Outlook
5. Implement better type validation and conversion for date parameters
6. Add more comprehensive testing for edge cases involving empty caches
