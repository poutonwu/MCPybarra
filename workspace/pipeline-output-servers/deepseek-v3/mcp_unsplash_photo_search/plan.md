Here is the detailed, actionable implementation plan for the MCP server based on the user's request for an automated image retrieval and processing system:

---

### **MCP Tools Plan**

#### **Tool 1: `search_photos`**
- **Description**: Searches for photos on Unsplash based on keywords, pagination, sorting, color, and orientation filters. Returns a list of photo details including ID, description, URLs for multiple sizes, width, and height.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (str, required): The search keyword(s) for photos.
  - `page` (int, optional): The page number for paginated results. Defaults to `1`.
  - `per_page` (int, optional): The number of results per page. Defaults to `10`.
  - `order_by` (str, optional): The sorting order for results (e.g., `latest`, `popular`). Defaults to `popular`.
  - `color` (str, optional): Filter photos by a specific color (e.g., `red`, `blue`). Optional.
  - `orientation` (str, optional): Filter photos by orientation (`landscape`, `portrait`, `squarish`). Optional.
- **Return Value**: 
  - A list of dictionaries, each containing:
    - `id` (str): Unique identifier for the photo.
    - `description` (str): Description or alt text of the photo.
    - `urls` (dict): URLs for different sizes (`raw`, `full`, `regular`, `small`, `thumb`).
    - `width` (int): Width of the photo in pixels.
    - `height` (int): Height of the photo in pixels.

### **Server Overview**
The MCP server will provide an automated image retrieval and processing service, specifically integrating with the Unsplash API to search for photos based on user-provided criteria. The server will expose a single tool (`search_photos`) to handle all search functionality, returning detailed photo metadata for further use.

### **File to be Generated**
- **Filename**: `mcp_unsplash_server.py`
- **Contents**: 
  - All server logic, including the `FastMCP` initialization, tool definition, and server execution, will be contained in this single file.

---

### **Dependencies**
1. **Required Libraries**:
   - `mcp[cli]`: For MCP server implementation.
   - `httpx`: For making HTTP requests to the Unsplash API.
   - `python-dotenv`: For managing API keys securely (optional but recommended).

2. **API Requirements**:
   - Unsplash API access (requires an API key).

This plan adheres strictly to the user's request and the MCP protocol guidelines, ensuring a focused and functional implementation. No additional tools or functionalities are included beyond what is explicitly required.
