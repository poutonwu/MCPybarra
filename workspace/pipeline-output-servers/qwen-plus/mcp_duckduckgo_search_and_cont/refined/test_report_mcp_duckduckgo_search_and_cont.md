## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `duck_duck_go_search`

#### Step: Happy path: Search with a standard query to test basic functionality.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "AI research 2024" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** DuckDuckGo搜索失败: https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/ RuntimeError: error sending request for url (https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/): client error (Connect)

#### Step: Happy path: Test search with max_results set within valid range.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "climate change news", "max_results": 8 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Same as above

#### Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of empty query input.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `'query' 参数不能为空。`

#### Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of out-of-range max_results value.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "technology trends", "max_results": 15 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `max_results 必须在1到10之间`

#### Step: Edge case: Search for a term unlikely to yield results, testing search robustness.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "nonexistentwebsite123456" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** DuckDuckGo搜索失败: https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit

### Tool: `fetch_content`

#### Step: Happy path: Fetch content from a valid URL to test basic functionality.
- **Tool:** `fetch_content`
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "https://example.com" }`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully fetched and cleaned content from example.com

#### Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of an invalid URL format.
- **Tool:** `fetch_content`
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "invalid-url" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `URL 必须以 http:// 或 https:// 开头`

#### Step: Happy path: Test fetch_content with a custom timeout value.
- **Tool:** `fetch_content`
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "https://example.com", "timeout": 5 }`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully fetched content with a custom timeout

---

### Dependent Tool Calls

#### Step: Dependent call setup: Search for URLs to be used in subsequent fetch step.
- **Tool:** `duck_duck_go_search`
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "latest AI news" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Same connection error as previous search calls

#### Step: Dependent call: Use the link from the first search result to fetch its content.
- **Tool:** `fetch_content`
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": null }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency.`

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch same URL but disable ad removal to test parameter behavior.
- **Tool:** `fetch_content`
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": null, "remove_ads": false }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Same as above

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
- The test plan covers all major functionalities of both tools:
  - Basic search and content fetching
  - Input validation
  - Edge cases
  - Dependent operations
- However, due to failures in the search function, dependent workflows could not be fully tested.

### Identified Issues

1. **DuckDuckGo Search Fails Due to Network/TLS Issues**
   - All calls to `duck_duck_go_search` failed with a TLS handshake error or rate limit.
   - This suggests either:
     - A network issue on the test machine
     - Incompatibility with DuckDuckGo's TLS settings
     - Rate limiting due to excessive search requests

2. **Missing Graceful Degradation or Retry Strategy**
   - Despite having retry logic in the code, the search still fails after retries.
   - The exponential backoff logic does not appear to be effective.

3. **Failure in Dependent Workflows**
   - Since the search tool fails, dependent steps using search results also fail.
   - This shows a lack of resilience in the system when a dependency fails.

### Stateful Operations
- The test included dependent operations (e.g., using search results to fetch content).
- However, due to the search tool failing, these workflows did not execute properly.

### Error Handling
- The server **does** handle invalid inputs correctly:
  - Empty queries and invalid max_results values are caught and raise appropriate exceptions.
  - Invalid URLs in `fetch_content` are rejected with clear messages.
- However, the **handling of external failures (e.g., network issues)** is not robust enough to prevent cascading failures.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
- The server has **good input validation and error messaging** for local failures.
- However, **critical external dependencies (DuckDuckGo)** are failing, leading to **complete breakdown of search functionality**.
- As a result, **dependent operations also fail**, and the system cannot fulfill its intended purpose.

### Recommendations
1. **Investigate and Fix DuckDuckGo Search Connectivity Issues**
   - Test from a different environment or network
   - Consider updating or patching the `duckduckgo_search` library
   - Implement better TLS configuration or fallback strategies

2. **Improve Error Handling for External Failures**
   - Consider returning a structured error response even when external tools fail
   - Add better logging for retry attempts

3. **Add Circuit Breaker or Fallback Logic**
   - If search repeatedly fails, temporarily disable dependent workflows gracefully
   - Provide an option to use cached or mock results in degraded mode

4. **Validate Dependent Workflow Behavior**
   - Test how the system behaves when dependencies fail
   - Ensure that dependent tools fail gracefully and provide actionable error messages
