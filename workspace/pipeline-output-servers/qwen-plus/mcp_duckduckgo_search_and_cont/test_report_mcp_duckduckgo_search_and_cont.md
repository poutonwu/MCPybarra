## 3. Detailed Test Results

### 🦆 Tool: `duck_duck_go_search`

#### ✅ Step: Happy path: Perform a basic search with default max_results=5.
- **Tool:** duck_duck_go_search
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "AI technology trends" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `DuckDuckGo搜索失败: https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/ 202 Ratelimit`

#### ✅ Step: Valid case: Search with custom max_results within allowed range (1-10).
- **Tool:** duck_duck_go_search
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "climate change news", "max_results": 8 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Error executing tool: `DuckDuckGo搜索失败: https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit`

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of an empty query input.
- **Tool:** duck_duck_go_search
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `'query' 参数不能为空。` — Expected failure due to validation.

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of max_results exceeding maximum allowed value.
- **Tool:** duck_duck_go_search
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "valid query", "max_results": 11 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `max_results 必须在1到10之间` — Expected validation failure.

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of max_results below minimum allowed value.
- **Tool:** duck_duck_go_search
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "valid query", "max_results": 0 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `max_results 必须在1到10之间` — Expected validation failure.

### 🕸️ Tool: `fetch_content`

#### ✅ Step: Dependent call: Fetch content from the first link returned by duck_duck_go_search.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": null }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency.` — Caused by prior failed search step.

#### ✅ Step: Dependent call: Fetch content with ad removal enabled to test cleanup functionality.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": null, "remove_ads": true }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Same as above — dependent on failed search.

#### ✅ Step: Dependent call: Fetch content with a custom timeout to test performance handling.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": null, "timeout": 5 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Same issue — no valid URL available from failed search.

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of an empty URL input.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `'url' 参数不能为空` — Expected validation error.

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of a malformed URL without http:// or https://.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "invalid-url-format" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `URL 必须以 http:// 或 https:// 开头` — Expected validation error.

#### ✅ Step: Edge case: Test server's handling of a valid but non-existent URL that returns HTTP 4xx/5xx.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "https://example.com/nonexistent-page-for-testing" }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `HTTP请求失败: Client error '404 Not Found'` — Expected behavior for invalid page.

#### ✅ Step: Validate server behavior when fetching slow-loading pages with extended timeout.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** `{ "url": "https://example.com/slow-loading-page", "timeout": 30 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `HTTP请求失败: Client error '404 Not Found'` — Page does not exist regardless of timeout.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

- All core functionalities were tested:
  - Search with different parameters
  - Content fetching with optional cleanup and timeouts
  - Input validation for both tools
- The test plan was comprehensive and included edge cases and dependent operations.

### Identified Issues

1. **Rate Limiting / API Access Issue**
   - Both successful searches failed due to rate limiting (`202 Ratelimit`) from DuckDuckGo endpoints.
   - This suggests either:
     - A lack of proper API access credentials.
     - Overuse of public endpoint or insufficient throttling/resilience logic in the client code.

2. **Missing JSON Import**
   - Although not visible in logs, the server source code originally omitted `import json`, which would have caused runtime errors unless fixed during development.

3. **No Fallback or Retry Logic**
   - The tool fails immediately upon hitting a rate limit; there is no retry mechanism or use of alternative endpoints.

4. **Dependent Steps Fail Cascadingly**
   - Since all initial search steps failed, all dependent `fetch_content` calls also failed due to missing URLs.

### Stateful Operations

- The test attempted to pass results between steps (e.g., using `$outputs.search_happy_path[0].link`), but since the initial search failed, these placeholders evaluated to `null`.

### Error Handling

- The server **did well** in terms of input validation:
  - Empty queries and URLs are caught early.
  - Malformed URLs and out-of-range integers are rejected clearly.
- However, **API-level failures** (like rate limiting) were handled poorly:
  - No meaningful retries or alternate strategies.
  - Errors were wrapped into generic `RuntimeError`, though messages were clear.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The server implementation shows strong input validation and structure, but it **fails critically during actual usage** due to inability to perform searches successfully (likely due to API rate limits or lack of authentication).

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Rate Limit Handling**
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff.
   - Consider rotating user agents or using authenticated API keys if available.

2. **Use Stable DuckDuckGo Search Library**
   - Ensure the `duckduckgo_search` package used is up-to-date and supports reliable search methods.

3. **Improve Resilience in Dependent Workflows**
   - Gracefully handle failed dependencies instead of propagating nulls.

4. **Add Logging and Monitoring**
   - Include detailed logging around search requests and responses to help debug issues like rate limiting.

5. **Ensure All Dependencies Are Installed**
   - Confirm `json` module is imported and all packages are installed correctly in the deployment environment.
