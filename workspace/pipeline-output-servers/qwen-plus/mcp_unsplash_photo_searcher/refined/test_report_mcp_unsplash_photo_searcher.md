- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "architecture", "orientation": "portrait" }`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully retrieved architecture images in portrait format.

#### ❌ Edge Case: Empty query should raise ValueError
- **Step:** Edge case: Empty query should raise ValueError.
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "" }`
- **Status:** ✅ Failure (as expected)
- **Result:** Error message: `"搜索关键词不能为空"`

#### ❌ Edge Case: Invalid page number (less than 1)
- **Step:** Edge case: Invalid page number (less than 1).
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "sunset", "page": 0 }`
- **Status:** ✅ Failure (as expected)
- **Result:** Error message: `"页码必须大于等于1"`

#### ❌ Edge Case: per_page exceeds maximum allowed value (30)
- **Step:** Edge case: per_page exceeds maximum allowed value (30).
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "flowers", "per_page": 35 }`
- **Status:** ✅ Failure (as expected)
- **Result:** Error message: `"每页结果数量必须在1到30之间"`

#### ❌ Edge Case: Invalid order_by value not in ['latest', 'oldest', 'relevant']
- **Step:** Edge case: Invalid order_by value not in ['latest', 'oldest', 'relevant'].
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "ocean", "order_by": "popular" }`
- **Status:** ✅ Failure (as expected)
- **Result:** Error message: `"排序方式必须是 latest, oldest, relevant 中的一个"`

#### ❌ Edge Case: Invalid orientation value not in ['landscape', 'portrait', 'squarish']
- **Step:** Edge case: Invalid orientation value not in ['landscape', 'portrait', 'squarish'].
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": "wildlife", "orientation": "circular" }`
- **Status:** ✅ Failure (as expected)
- **Result:** Error message: `"图片方向必须是 landscape, portrait, squarish 中的一个或None"`

#### ❌ Dependent Call: Use description from previous result as new query
- **Step:** Dependent call: Use description from the first result of previous search as new query.
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": null }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Dependency failed due to unresolved placeholder: `$outputs.search_photos_happy_path.results[0].description`

#### ❌ Dependent Call: Second page using same unresolved query
- **Step:** Dependent call: Search again on second page using same query from previous step.
- **Parameters:** `{ "query": null, "page": 2 }`
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Dependency failed due to unresolved placeholder: `$outputs.search_photos_happy_path.results[0].description`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan thoroughly exercised the core capabilities of the `search_photos` tool:
- Basic keyword search
- Pagination (`page`, `per_page`)
- Sorting (`order_by`)
- Filtering (`color`, `orientation`)
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Placeholder usage for dependent calls

All required parameters and optional ones were tested.

### Identified Issues

1. **Unresolved Placeholders in Dependent Steps**
   - **Steps Affected:** `search_photos_first_result_description`, `search_photos_second_page_same_query`
   - **Cause:** Attempted to use dynamic output from a prior step (`$outputs...`) which was not resolved correctly.
   - **Impact:** Prevented dependent steps from executing properly.
   - **Note:** This is likely an issue with the test runner or placeholder resolution logic rather than the server itself.

### Stateful Operations

The server does not maintain state between requests. Each request is self-contained and independent. However, the test framework attempted to simulate stateful behavior via placeholders, which failed due to unresolved references.

### Error Handling

Error handling is robust:
- Clear and localized error messages are returned for invalid inputs.
- Exceptions are caught and re-raised with appropriate context.
- HTTP errors from Unsplash API are propagated clearly.

This indicates strong defensive programming practices.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The `mcp_unsplash_photo_searcher` server demonstrates high stability and correctness:
- Core functionality is well-implemented and reliable.
- Input validation and error handling are thorough and user-friendly.
- Edge cases are handled gracefully with descriptive feedback.
- Only two failures occurred, both stemming from unresolved dependencies in the test runner.

### Recommendations

1. **Improve Test Runner Placeholder Resolution**
   - Ensure that output placeholders like `$outputs.step_id.result[0].field` resolve correctly when used across steps.
   - Add support for conditional or fallback values if resolution fails.

2. **Add Optional Timeout Configuration**
   - While timeout is currently hard-coded at 10 seconds, allowing users to configure this via environment variables would improve flexibility.

3. **Enhance Rate Limiting Behavior**
   - The current retry logic with exponential backoff is good, but consider logging rate limit hits more verbosely or exposing metrics for monitoring.

4. **Add Example Usage in Tool Description**
   - Including a brief example input/output in the tool schema or docstring could help clients understand expected formats.

5. **Support Returning Raw JSON Object Instead of String**
   - Currently returns a JSON string; returning a native dict/json object may simplify client-side parsing.
