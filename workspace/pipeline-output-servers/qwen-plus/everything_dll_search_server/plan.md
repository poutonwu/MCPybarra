Based on the research findings, we understand that using `ctypes` to load DLLs in Python involves utilizing `ctypes.CDLL` and ensuring correct calling conventions and data types. With this understanding, let's proceed to create the implementation plan for the MCP server.

### Server Overview

The MCP server will be designed to automate file retrieval and processing by leveraging the `everything.dll` library through ctypes. It will provide high-speed search capabilities for files and folders on Windows systems, supporting a variety of search syntaxes including wildcards, regex, paths, sizes, dates, and attributes. The server will also offer advanced features such as result sorting, size filtering, case sensitivity, exact matching, and regex matching based on user-defined query conditions.

### File Structure

- **mcp_file_search_server.py**: This single Python file will contain all the necessary code for the server initialization, tool definitions, and the FastMCP instance setup.

### MCP Tools Plan

#### Function Name: `search_files`

**Description**: Executes a file search on the local Windows system using the loaded `everything.dll` with the specified query parameters.

**Parameters**:
- `query`: str - The search query which may include various search syntax (wildcard, regex, etc.)
- `sort_by`: str - The attribute by which to sort the results (e.g., name, path, size, date)
- `max_results`: int - The maximum number of search results to return
- `case_sensitive`: bool - Whether the search should be case-sensitive
- `match_whole_word`: bool - Whether the search should match whole words only
- `use_regex`: bool - Whether to interpret the query as a regular expression

**Return Value**: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains detailed information about a found file or folder.

### Dependencies

- `ctypes`: To interface with the `everything.dll` for executing searches.
- `mcp[cli]`: For setting up the MCP server and integrating with external tools and data sources.
- `httpx`: If making any asynchronous HTTP requests is required within the server implementation.

This plan outlines the structure and functionality of the MCP server without delving into specific code implementations. It provides a clear roadmap for the development process while adhering to best practices identified through research.
