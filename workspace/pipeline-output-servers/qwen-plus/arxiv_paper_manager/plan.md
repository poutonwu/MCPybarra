### Server Overview
The purpose of this MCP server is to automate the processing of arXiv academic paper searches, downloads, and reading. It will provide users with the ability to search for papers based on query conditions, download PDF files of selected papers, list downloaded papers for management, and read the text content of specified papers.

### File Structure
```
arxiv_mcp_server/
└── arxiv_mcp_server.py  # Contains the FastMCP server implementation and tool definitions.

### MCP Tools Plan

#### Tool: `search_papers`
- **Description**: Searches for academic papers on arXiv based on user-provided query conditions and returns a list of matching papers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: str - The search query (e.g., keywords, author names, or other criteria).
- **Return Value**: A JSON-formatted string containing a list of paper metadata (titles, authors, abstracts, and arXiv IDs).

#### Tool: `download_paper`
- **Description**: Downloads the PDF file of a specified arXiv paper using its arXiv ID and stores it locally.
- **Parameters**:
  - `paper_id`: str - The unique identifier of the arXiv paper (e.g., '1706.03762').
- **Return Value**: A string message indicating success or failure of the download operation.

#### Tool: `list_papers`
- **Description**: Lists all papers that have been downloaded and stored locally, providing an interface for querying and managing these papers.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Return Value**: A JSON-formatted string containing a list of locally stored papers' metadata (titles, authors, and local file paths).

#### Tool: `read_paper`
- **Description**: Reads and provides access to the textual content of a specified academic paper by parsing its locally stored PDF file.
- **Parameters**:
  - `paper_id`: str - The unique identifier of the arXiv paper whose content needs to be accessed.
- **Return Value**: A JSON-formatted string containing the parsed text content of the specified paper.

### Dependencies
- `mcp[cli]` - For implementing the MCP protocol server.
- `httpx` - To handle asynchronous HTTP requests when interacting with the arXiv API.
- `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six` - For reading and extracting text from PDF files of academic papers.
- `arxiv` - A Python library for interacting with the arXiv API to search for papers and retrieve metadata.
