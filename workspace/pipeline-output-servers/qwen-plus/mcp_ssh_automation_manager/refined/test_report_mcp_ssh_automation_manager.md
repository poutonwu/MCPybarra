- **Result:** Session successfully disconnected

#### ✅ Verify session list after disconnect
- **Step:** Confirm that the session was removed after disconnection.
- **Tool:** list_sessions
- **Parameters:** {}
- **Result:** No active sessions listed

#### ❌ Connect with invalid host
- **Step:** Attempt to connect with invalid host and credentials to test error handling.
- **Tool:** connect
- **Parameters:** {"host": "", "port": 22, "username": "invaliduser", "password": "wrongpass"}
- **Result:** Error: "'host' 必须是有效的字符串。"

#### ❌ Connect with invalid port
- **Step:** Attempt to connect with an invalid port number (0) to test validation logic.
- **Tool:** connect
- **Parameters:** {"host": "10.70.4.146", "port": 0, "username": "pengbocheng", "password": "123456"}
- **Result:** Error: "'port' 必须是1到65535之间的有效整数。"

### Command Execution

#### ✅ Execute simple command
- **Step:** Execute a simple echo command on the connected session to test command execution.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "b5d1f823-0a32-4c4e-896f-75f43b1506c4", "command": "echo 'Hello from remote server'"}
- **Result:** Command executed successfully with expected output

#### ❌ Execute command with standard input
- **Step:** Test command execution with standard input.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "b5d1f823-0a32-4c4e-896f-75f43b1506c4", "command": "cat", "stdin_input": "This is standard input data."}
- **Result:** Tool 'execute' execution timed out (exceeded 60 seconds)

#### ❌ Execute command on invalid session
- **Step:** Attempt to execute a command on a non-existent session to test error handling.
- **Tool:** execute
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "nonexistent_session_id", "command": "echo 'should fail'"}
- **Result:** Error: "无效的会话ID: nonexistent_session_id"

### File Transfer

#### ✅ Upload test file
- **Step:** Upload a local test file to the remote server to verify file transfer functionality.
- **Tool:** upload
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "b5d1f823-0a32-4c4e-896f-75f43b1506c4", "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\执行结果文本.txt", "remote_path": "/tmp/执行结果文本.txt"}
- **Result:** File uploaded successfully with correct size

#### ✅ Download test file
- **Step:** Download the previously uploaded file back to ensure download functionality works correctly.
- **Tool:** download
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "b5d1f823-0a32-4c4e-896f-75f43b1506c4", "remote_path": "/tmp/执行结果文本.txt", "local_path": "D:\\devWorkspace\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\下载_执行结果文本.txt"}
- **Result:** File downloaded successfully with correct size

#### ❌ Upload with invalid paths
- **Step:** Attempt to upload with invalid session ID and file paths to test robustness.
- **Tool:** upload
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "nonexistent_session_id", "local_path": "invalid_local_path.txt", "remote_path": "/invalid/remote/path.txt"}
- **Result:** Error: "无效的会话ID: nonexistent_session_id"

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The main functionalities were thoroughly tested:
- Connection management (connect/disconnect/list_sessions)
- Command execution (execute)
- File transfer (upload/download)

All core operations were validated with both success and failure scenarios.

### Identified Issues
1. **Command Timeout Issue**
   - `execute` tool failed when attempting to run the `cat` command with stdin input
   - The operation timed out after 60 seconds despite being a simple command
   - This suggests potential issues with how stdin is handled or how timeout is implemented

2. **Input Validation Inconsistency**
   - Some tools (like `upload`) only validate session existence but not file paths
   - This could lead to unnecessary network calls before failing locally

### Stateful Operations
- Session state management worked well overall
- Session IDs were properly maintained between steps
- Dependent operations (e.g., execute after connect) functioned correctly
- Disconnection properly cleaned up resources and session state

### Error Handling
- Generally good error messages with meaningful Chinese descriptions
- Parameter validation errors were clear and specific
- However, some failures returned generic messages without detailed context
- Timeouts should be better handled with more informative messages

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The SSH MCP server demonstrates solid core functionality with reliable connection management, command execution, and file transfer capabilities. Most tests passed successfully, and error handling was generally appropriate.

**Recommendations:**
1. Improve handling of long-running commands by:
   - Adding configurable timeouts at the tool level
   - Implementing proper stdin/stdout handling for interactive commands like `cat`

2. Enhance input validation:
   - Validate file paths exist before attempting transfers
   - Add validation for command length and complexity

3. Improve error messaging:
   - Include more context in timeout errors
   - Differentiate between authentication failures and network issues

4. Consider implementing:
   - Session keep-alive functionality
   - Better progress tracking for large file transfers
   - Support for recursive directory transfers
