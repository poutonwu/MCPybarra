## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

✅ All major functionalities were tested:
- Image statistics
- Resizing and cropping
- Filtering
- Edge detection
- Thresholding
- Contour detection
- Shape detection

However, dependent workflows failed due to unresolved placeholders from prior steps.

### Identified Issues

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔗 Chaining Failures | Several test steps failed because they relied on outputs from earlier steps, which themselves had errors or returned unparseable results. |
| 📝 Truncation Note | Some outputs were truncated by the MCP adapter, limiting visibility into full results (e.g., list of detected shapes). |

### Stateful Operations

❌ The server does not currently support stateful chaining of operations effectively. When one step fails in a dependency chain, all subsequent steps fail silently due to missing parameters.

### Error Handling

✅ Most tools provided clear and actionable error messages for invalid input:
- File not found
- Invalid dimensions
- Kernel size requirements
- Coordinate boundaries

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The `mcp_opencv_image_processing_cv` server demonstrates solid core functionality with robust implementation of common image processing tasks. However, it struggles with dependent operation chains due to improper resolution of dynamic parameters from prior steps.

### ✅ Strengths:
- Comprehensive toolset
- Good input validation
- Clear error messages
- Unicode path support
- Proper image handling

### 🛠️ Recommendations:
1. **Improve Dynamic Parameter Resolution** – Ensure proper parsing and fallback behavior when extracting values from previous step outputs.
2. **Add Better Chain Dependency Management** – Implement a mechanism to halt dependent steps if a prerequisite fails.
3. **Handle Adapter Truncation Gracefully** – Where possible, return summary data that avoids truncation impact (e.g., counts instead of full lists).
4. **Enhance Tool Documentation** – Clarify expected formats for dynamic parameter extraction from result strings.
