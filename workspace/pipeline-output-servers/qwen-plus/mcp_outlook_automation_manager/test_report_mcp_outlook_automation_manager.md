### get_email_by_number - Access email with invalid index

- **Step:** Edge case: Attempt to access an email with an invalid index to test error handling.
- **Tool:** get_email_by_number
- **Parameters:** {"email_index": -1}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure

- **Tool:** reply_to_email_by_number
- **Parameters:** {"email_index": 0, "reply_content": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** No emails in cache. Please run list_recent_emails or search_emails first.

---

### search_emails - Invalid date format

- **Step:** Edge case: Use incorrect date format for start_date to test input validation.
- **Tool:** search_emails
- **Parameters:** {"start_date": "10/10/2023", "end_date": "2023-10-17"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** Invalid date format: time data '10/10/2023' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d'

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The main functionalities were tested:
- Folder listing ✅
- Email retrieval ❌
- Email search ❌
- Email detail view ❌
- Replying to emails ❌
- Composing new emails ✅

However, several core functions failed, particularly those involving email retrieval and processing.

### Identified Issues

1. **Folder Name Localization Issue**
   - The `list_recent_emails` tool assumes a folder named "收件箱" exists, but the actual folder name returned by `list_folders` is "Inbox"
   - This causes failures in subsequent dependent operations that rely on cached emails
   - Impact: Breaks entire workflow chain relying on email retrieval

2. **Missing Precondition Handling**
   - Several tools (`get_email_by_number`, `reply_to_email_by_number`) fail when no emails are cached
   - While documented in tool descriptions, error messages don't suggest corrective actions

3. **Parameter Resolution Failure**
   - The test framework attempted to use output from failed steps as parameters for subsequent steps
   - Caused cascading failures even when tools themselves might have worked correctly

4. **Date Format Validation**
   - `search_emails` properly validates date formats but doesn't support multiple formats
   - Could be improved with more flexible parsing

### Stateful Operations

The server relies on stateful operations where certain tools require prior execution of others (like caching emails). However, since the initial email retrieval fails, most dependent operations cannot proceed successfully.

### Error Handling

Error handling is generally good in terms of raising appropriate exceptions:
- Clear error messages for invalid dates
- Proper error propagation from lower-level exceptions
- Good documentation of possible errors in tool docstrings

However, error recovery suggestions could be improved:
- Better guidance on how to resolve folder name mismatch issue
- More actionable error messages for empty cache scenarios

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server implementation shows promise but has critical issues preventing reliable usage:

**Conclusion:**
- Connectivity works ✅
- Core email functionality fails ❌
- Basic composition works ✅
- State management needs improvement ❌
- Error handling is clear but could be more helpful ❓

**Recommendations:**

1. **Fix Folder Path Localization**
   - Make folder names configurable or detect actual folder names from `list_folders` output
   - Add fallback logic for default folders like Inbox

2. **Improve Cache Management**
   - Allow explicit cache population
   - Provide clearer error messages with suggested corrective actions

3. **Enhance Date Parsing Flexibility**
   - Support multiple common date formats in `search_emails`

4. **Add Tool Dependencies Awareness**
   - In test framework: skip dependent tests if prerequisite steps fail

5. **Improve Documentation**
   - Clarify folder naming expectations
   - Document language requirements (English vs Chinese folder names)

6. **Add Folder Name Mapping**
   - Create a mapping between localized names and actual folder names

7. **Implement Fallback Folder Detection**
   - If "收件箱" not found, try English equivalents like "Inbox"

8. **Test Framework Improvements**
   - Skip dependent tests when prerequisites fail
   - Avoid attempting to resolve placeholders from failed steps
