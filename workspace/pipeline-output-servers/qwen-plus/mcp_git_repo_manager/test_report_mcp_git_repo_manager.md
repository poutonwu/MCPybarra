## 3. Detailed Test Results

### git_init Tool

#### Step: Happy path: Initialize a new git repository in a fresh directory
**Tool:** git_init  
**Parameters:** {"repo_path": "$temp_dir/repo1"}  
**Status:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** Successfully initialized new repository at $temp_dir/repo1

### Missing write_to_temp_file Tool

#### Step: Setup: Create a test file to work with
**Tool:** write_to_temp_file  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/repo1/test.txt", "content": "This is a test file for git operations."}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Tool 'write_to_temp_file' not found in adapter

#### Step: Modify the test file to create a change
**Tool:** write_to_temp_file  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/repo1/test.txt", "content": "This file has been modified for testing purposes."}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Tool 'write_to_temp_file' not found in adapter

#### Step: Create a file to use for conflict testing
**Tool:** write_to_temp_file  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/repo1/conflict.txt", "content": "Conflict resolution test content."}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Tool 'write_to_temp_file' not found in adapter

#### Step: Create conflicting content on master branch
**Tool:** write_to_temp_file  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/repo1/conflict.txt", "content": "Different content for conflict test on master."}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** Tool 'write_to_temp_file' not found in adapter

### Dependent Operations Failures

All dependent steps failed because they couldn't access outputs from previous steps due to the missing write_to_temp_file tool:

- check_status_empty_repo (git_status)
- add_file_to_git (git_add)
- check_diff_unstaged_after_add (git_diff_unstaged)
- check_diff_staged_after_add (git_diff_staged)
- commit_added_file (git_commit)
- check_status_modified (git_status)
- diff_unstaged_modified (git_diff_unstaged)
- add_modified_file (git_add)
- commit_modified_file (git_commit)
- check_log (git_log)
- show_first_commit (git_show)
- create_new_branch (git_create_branch)
- checkout_new_branch (git_checkout)
- add_conflict_file (git_add)
- commit_conflict_file (git_commit)
- checkout_master (git_checkout)
- add_conflicting_file (git_add)
- commit_conflicting_file (git_commit)
- merge_branches (git_merge)
- reset_conflict_file (git_reset)
- compare_commits (git_diff)

### Edge Case Testing

#### Step: Edge case: Test with invalid repository path
**Tool:** git_status  
**Parameters:** {"repo_path": "/nonexistent/path"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"status": "error", "error_type": "ValueError", "message": "无效的仓库路径: /nonexistent/path"}

#### Step: Edge case: Test with invalid commit hash
**Tool:** git_show  
**Parameters:** {"repo_path": null, "commit_hash": "invalidhash1234567890"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to create branch with empty name
**Tool:** git_create_branch  
**Parameters:** {"repo_path": null, "branch_name": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered all major Git repository management functionalities:
- Repository initialization
- File staging and committing
- Status checks and diff operations
- Branch management
- Commit history viewing
- Conflict creation and resolution attempts

However, the core functionality could not be fully tested due to a missing file manipulation tool.

### Identified Issues

1. **Missing write_to_temp_file Tool**: This was the root cause of most failures. Without this tool, no files could be created or modified in the repository, making most Git operations impossible to test.
   
2. **Dependency Chain Breakdown**: When one step fails, all dependent steps receive null parameters and fail as well, creating a cascade failure effect.

3. **Incomplete Error Handling for git_merge**: Although not tested due to earlier failures, there's no implementation for git_merge in the provided code.

### Stateful Operations
The server's stateful operation handling appears sound in theory, but couldn't be properly tested due to the missing file manipulation tool breaking the dependency chain.

### Error Handling
For direct errors (like invalid paths), the server demonstrates good error handling by returning clear JSON-formatted error messages. However, it lacks proper handling of cascading failures where one step's failure causes multiple subsequent failures.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server implementation appears technically correct based on the single successful test, which verified that repository initialization works as expected. However, the absence of the write_to_temp_file tool prevented meaningful testing of nearly all other functionality.

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement the missing write_to_temp_file tool to enable file creation and modification within test repositories
2. Add better handling of cascading failures to prevent a single failed step from invalidating an entire test sequence
3. Implement the missing git_merge tool referenced in the test plan
4. Improve error messages for placeholder resolution failures to help diagnose dependency issues more quickly
5. Consider adding validation to skip dependent tests when prerequisite steps fail rather than continuing with null parameters
