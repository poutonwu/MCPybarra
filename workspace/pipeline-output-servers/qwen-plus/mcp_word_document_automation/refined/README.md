# mcp_word_document_automation

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for automating Microsoft Word document creation and manipulation.

## Overview

The `mcp_word_document_automation` server enables seamless integration between large language models (LLMs) and Python-based Word document automation using the `python-docx` library. It allows LLMs to create, open, edit, and manage Word documents programmatically through a set of well-defined tools.

This server supports operations such as adding paragraphs and headings, inserting tables, searching and replacing text, modifying document structure, and adjusting layout settings like page margins.
