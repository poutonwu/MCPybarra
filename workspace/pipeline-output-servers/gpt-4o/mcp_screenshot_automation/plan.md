# Implementation Plan for MCP Server: Automated Screenshot Capture

## MCP Tools Plan

### Tool 1: `take_screenshot`
- **Description**: Captures the current screen content and returns it as an image object.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Return Value**: 
  - Type: `PIL.Image.Image`
  - Description: An image object representing the screenshot of the current screen.

### Tool 2: `take_screenshot_image`
- **Description**: Captures the current screen content and returns it as a directly displayable image.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Return Value**: 
  - Type: `bytes`
  - Description: A byte stream of the captured screenshot, suitable for direct display or embedding.

### Tool 3: `take_screenshot_path`
- **Description**: Captures the current screen content and saves it to a user-specified local file path with a custom file name.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_path` (type: `str`): The full path where the screenshot will be saved, including the file name and extension.
- **Return Value**: 
  - Type: `str`
  - Description: A confirmation message indicating the file was successfully saved, including the full file path.

## Server Overview
The MCP server will provide automated screenshot functionality through three tools:
1. `take_screenshot`: Returns the current screen as an image object.
2. `take_screenshot_image`: Returns the current screen content as a byte stream for direct display.
3. `take_screenshot_path`: Saves the screen capture to a specified file path with a custom name.

The server will use the MCP protocol and Python's `pyautogui` and `Pillow` libraries for capturing and processing screenshots.

---

## File to be Generated
The server implementation will be contained in a single Python file named `screenshot_mcp_server.py`.

---

## Dependencies
1. **`mcp[cli]`**: For implementing the MCP server framework.
2. **`pyautogui`**: To capture screenshots of the current screen.
3. **`Pillow (PIL)`**: For handling and manipulating image objects.
