  - Saving the screenshot to a specified file path with format validation
- **Overall Result:** ✅ All tests passed successfully.
- **Key Statistics:**
  - Total Tests Executed: 6
  - Successful Tests: 6
  - Failed Tests: 0

---

## 2. Test Environment

- **Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution
- **MCP Server Tools:**
  - `take_screenshot`
  - `take_screenshot_image`
  - `take_screenshot_path`

---

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `take_screenshot`

#### Step: Happy path: Capture the current screen and verify that an image object is returned.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot
- **Parameters:** {}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully returned an image object (`PIL.Image.Image`) representing the captured screen.

---

### Tool: `take_screenshot_image`

#### Step: Happy path: Capture the current screen and verify that a Base64-encoded byte stream of the image is returned.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot_image
- **Parameters:** {}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully returned a Base64-encoded string representing the screenshot image.

---

### Tool: `take_screenshot_path`

#### Step: Happy path: Capture the current screen and save it to a valid file path with a .png extension.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.png"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Screenshot saved successfully at the specified location.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to save the screenshot to a file with an unsupported extension and verify error handling.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\invalid_extension.txt"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success (Expected Failure)
- **Result:** Correctly failed with message: `"Invalid file extension. Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .gif"`

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to save the screenshot to a non-existent directory and verify error handling.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\nonexistent\\directory\\screenshot.png"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success (Expected Failure)
- **Result:** Correctly failed with message: `"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'D:\\\\nonexistent\\\\directory\\\\screenshot.png'"`

---

#### Step: Dependent call: Overwrite an existing file and ensure the tool can handle overwriting without errors.

- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.png"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully overwrote the existing file without error.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan provided comprehensive coverage for all three tools:

- `take_screenshot`: Basic functionality tested
- `take_screenshot_image`: Basic functionality tested
- `take_screenshot_path`: Multiple cases tested including happy path, invalid extension, missing directory, and overwrite behavior

All core functionalities were exercised thoroughly.

---

### Identified Issues

✅ **No actual issues identified** during testing. All tests executed as expected, including edge cases which correctly returned appropriate error messages.

---

### Stateful Operations

There are no stateful operations in this server implementation — each tool operates independently and does not rely on shared session or context from previous calls. Therefore, there was no need to manage or pass state between steps beyond what was already handled by the automated test runner.

---

### Error Handling

Error handling is robust and appropriate:

- Invalid file extensions are caught and reported clearly
- Missing directories result in clear OS-level error propagation
- The system gracefully handles overwriting existing files

Each failure case resulted in a meaningful, actionable error message.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The `mcp_screenshot_automation` server demonstrates high stability and correctness based on the test results. All tools behave as expected under both normal and edge-case conditions.

### Recommendations:

1. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Add support for more image formats (e.g., `.webp`)
   - Include optional parameters like region cropping or delay before capture
   - Return additional metadata (e.g., image dimensions, DPI) in response objects

2. **Future Improvements:**
   - Consider adding cleanup logic in tests to remove generated files after successful runs
   - Implement unit tests for individual functions outside of integration scenarios

3. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure consistent docstring formatting across tools
   - Add versioning information in server initialization
