## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `take_screenshot`

#### Step: Happy path: Capture a screenshot using take_screenshot and return the serialized image object.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot  
- **Parameters:** {}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully captured screenshot and returned PIL image object.

---

### Tool: `take_screenshot_image`

#### Step: Happy path: Capture a screenshot using take_screenshot_image and return the byte stream of the image.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_image  
- **Parameters:** {}  
- **Status:** ❌ Failure  
- **Result:** Error serializing to JSON: invalid utf-8 sequence of 1 bytes from index 69199

---

### Tool: `take_screenshot_path`

#### Step: Happy path: Save a screenshot to a valid file path with .png extension.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.png"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Screenshot saved successfully at specified path.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to save a screenshot to an unsupported file format (.txt). Expect error due to invalid extension.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.txt"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success (Expected failure behavior)  
- **Result:** Correctly rejected with message: Invalid file extension. Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .gif

---

#### Step: Dependent call: Overwrite the previously saved screenshot. Uses same file path as 'take_screenshot_path_valid' step.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.png"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully overwrote existing file.

---

#### Step: Happy path: Save a screenshot in a different supported format (.jpg).
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.jpg"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully saved in .jpg format.

---

#### Step: Happy path: Save a screenshot in .gif format, which is supported.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.gif"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully saved in .gif format.

---

#### Step: Happy path: Save a screenshot in .bmp format, which is supported.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\test_screenshot.bmp"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success  
- **Result:** Successfully saved in .bmp format.

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to save screenshot to an invalid or non-existent drive/path. Expect error due to invalid directory.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": "Z:\\invalid\\path\\screenshot.png"}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success (Expected failure behavior)  
- **Result:** System correctly reported: No such file or directory

---

#### Step: Edge case: Pass empty string as file path. Expect validation or I/O error.
- **Tool:** take_screenshot_path  
- **Parameters:** {"file_path": ""}  
- **Status:** ✅ Success (Expected failure behavior)  
- **Result:** Rejected with message: Invalid file extension. Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .gif

## 4. Analysis and Findings

**Functionality Coverage:**  
All core functionalities were tested thoroughly:
- Capturing screenshots and returning them directly as objects or byte streams.
- Saving screenshots to disk in all supported formats.
- Handling edge cases including invalid paths, unsupported extensions, and empty inputs.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **`take_screenshot_image` tool fails during JSON serialization of byte stream**  
   - This suggests that while the tool captures the screenshot correctly, it returns binary data in a format not suitable for direct JSON transmission.
   - Impact: Client applications expecting raw image bytes via this tool will fail unless special encoding/handling is implemented.

**Stateful Operations:**  
No stateful operations were involved in this server, so no dependencies between steps caused failures. The overwrite test confirmed that saving to an existing path works as expected.

**Error Handling:**  
The server demonstrated strong error handling:
- Invalid file extensions are caught early and clearly communicated.
- Empty or malformed file paths are validated before attempting I/O.
- Attempts to write to invalid directories result in appropriate OS-level errors.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server functions largely as intended, with comprehensive coverage of its capabilities. However, there is one critical issue with the `take_screenshot_image` tool where the byte stream cannot be transmitted due to JSON serialization failure.

**Recommendations:**
- Modify the `take_screenshot_image` tool to encode the byte stream using Base64 or another JSON-safe encoding method.
- Consider adding support for specifying output format in `take_screenshot_image` if needed.
- Ensure consistent use of string encoding across all tools to prevent future serialization issues.
