  - `include_domains` (list of strings, optional): Domains to include in the search results.
  - `exclude_domains` (list of strings, optional): Domains to exclude from the search results.
  - `max_results` (integer, optional): Maximum number of search results to return.
- **Return Value**: A JSON object containing:
  - `results` (list of objects): Each object includes:
    - `title` (string): Title of the webpage.
    - `url` (string): URL of the webpage.
    - `snippet` (string): Summary or snippet of the webpage content.

## Server Overview
The MCP server will provide automation for web search, direct answers, and news retrieval using the Tavily API. It will support precise search control (e.g., domain inclusion/exclusion, time range for news), configurable result limits, and structured outputs tailored for integration with external systems.

---

## File to be Generated
- **Filename**: `mcp_tavily_server.py`
- All server logic and tool implementations will be self-contained within this single Python file.

---

## Dependencies
- **Tavily API SDK**: For interacting with the Tavily API.
- **json-rpc**: For implementing the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol in Python.
- **httpx**: For making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Tavily API.
- **pydantic**: For data validation and structured data modeling.
