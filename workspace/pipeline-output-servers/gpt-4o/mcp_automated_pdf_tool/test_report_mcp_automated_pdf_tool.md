  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success (as expected behavior)
- **Result:** Correctly raised error: `"Page number 999 is out of range."`

---

### Tool: `merge_pdfs_ordered`

#### Step: Test exact matching merge order based on filename patterns.
- **Tool:** `merge_pdfs_ordered`
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "file_paths": [
      "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\2023.nlposs-1.24.pdf",
      "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\道路交通安全违法行为处理程序规定.pdf"
    ],
    "order": ["违法", "nlposs"],
    "fuzzy_match": false,
    "output_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\ordered_merge_exact.pdf"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Files merged in specified order using exact match.

---

#### Step: Test fuzzy matching merge order based on approximate filename patterns.
- **Tool:** `merge_pdfs_ordered`
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "file_paths": [
      "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\2023.nlposs-1.24.pdf",
      "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\道路交通安全违法行为处理程序规定.pdf"
    ],
    "order": ["traffic", "paper"],
    "fuzzy_match": true,
    "output_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\ordered_merge_partial.pdf"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Fuzzy matching worked; files merged in correct inferred order.

---

### Tool: `find_related_pdfs`

#### Step: Find related PDFs to a given target file by content similarity.
- **Tool:** `find_related_pdfs`
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "target_file": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\2023.nlposs-1.24.pdf",
    "directory": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Only the target file itself was returned, which is expected if no other files matched content similarity threshold.

---

### Tool: `merge_pdfs` (Edge Case)

#### Step: Edge case - Attempt to merge an empty list of files.
- **Tool:** `merge_pdfs`
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "file_paths": [],
    "output_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\empty_merge_output.pdf"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Empty merge resulted in an empty output file, which may be considered acceptable depending on intended use, but could benefit from input validation.

---

### Tool: `search_pdfs` (Edge Case)

#### Step: Edge case - Search for non-existent file type.
- **Tool:** `search_pdfs`
- **Parameters:**
  ```json
  {
    "directory": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles",
    "pattern": "*.xyz"
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** No matches found — expected behavior.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

**Functionality Coverage:**  
All core functionalities provided by the server were tested:
- File merging
- Page extraction
- File search
- Ordered merging (exact and fuzzy)
- Content-based related file discovery

The test plan appears comprehensive, covering both happy paths and edge cases.

**Identified Issues:**
- None that indicate bugs or incorrect behavior. The only edge case where an invalid page number was requested correctly returned a descriptive error.

**Stateful Operations:**  
No stateful operations were tested (e.g., session management). All tools are stateless and operate purely on provided file paths.

**Error Handling:**  
Error handling is robust:
- Invalid page numbers are caught and reported clearly.
- Empty merges result in an empty file — this could optionally be flagged with a warning.
- Non-matching searches return empty lists — consistent with system expectations.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server demonstrates stable and correct behavior across all tested scenarios. Error messages are clear and actionable, and tools perform their intended functions accurately.

### Recommendations:
1. **Input Validation for Empty Lists in `merge_pdfs`:** Consider adding a check to prevent merging an empty list unless explicitly allowed, returning an error or warning.
2. **Enhance `find_related_pdfs` Testing:** Additional testing with more varied content would better validate the Jaccard similarity logic.
3. **Add Optional Logging or Output Confirmation:** For silent success cases like `merge_pdfs`, optional confirmation output can improve visibility during debugging.
