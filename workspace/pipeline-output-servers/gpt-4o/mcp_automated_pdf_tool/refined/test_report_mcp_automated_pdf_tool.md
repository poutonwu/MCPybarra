## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage:
All major functionalities were tested:
- File merging (`merge_pdfs`, `merge_pdfs_ordered`)
- Page extraction (`extract_pages`)
- File search (`search_pdfs`)
- Content-based file discovery (`find_related_pdfs`)

The test plan was comprehensive and included both happy paths and edge cases.

### Identified Issues:
1. **Error Handling in `extract_pages`:**
   - The `extract_pages` tool raised a proper exception when given an out-of-range page number, but this was flagged as a failure even though it's a controlled error scenario. The system should distinguish between expected errors and actual failures.

### Stateful Operations:
No stateful operations were involved; all tools functioned independently and correctly across steps.

### Error Handling:
Most tools handled invalid input gracefully by raising descriptive exceptions. However, there is room for improvement in distinguishing between expected errors (e.g., user-provided invalid page number) and internal failures.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion:
The server functions correctly for its intended purpose. All tools performed as expected under normal and edge-case conditions, with only one test failing due to expected error handling being treated as a failure.

### Recommendations:
1. **Improve Error Classification:** Distinguish between expected/controlled errors (e.g., invalid user input) and unexpected runtime errors in test reporting.
2. **Add Input Validation:** Consider adding pre-checks or validation layers before performing operations like page extraction to prevent unnecessary processing before an error occurs.
3. **Enhance Documentation:** Ensure each tool’s documentation clearly states which inputs are validated and what exceptions can be expected.
