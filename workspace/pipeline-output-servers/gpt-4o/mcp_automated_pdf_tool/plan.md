# MCP Tools Plan

## Tool 1: `merge_pdfs`
- **Function Name**: `merge_pdfs`
- **Description**: Merges multiple PDF files into a single file.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_paths`: List[str] - A list of file paths to the PDF files to be merged.
  - `output_path`: str - The path where the merged PDF will be saved.
- **Return Value**: 
  - None. The merged PDF is saved to the specified `output_path`.

## Tool 2: `extract_pages`
- **Function Name**: `extract_pages`
- **Description**: Extracts specific pages from a PDF file and saves them as a new PDF file.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_path`: str - The path to the input PDF file.
  - `page_numbers`: List[int] - A list of page numbers to extract.
  - `output_path`: str - The path where the new PDF file will be saved.
- **Return Value**: 
  - None. The extracted pages are saved to the specified `output_path`.

## Tool 3: `search_pdfs`
- **Function Name**: `search_pdfs`
- **Description**: Searches for PDF files matching a specific pattern in a given directory.
- **Parameters**:
  - `directory`: str - The directory to search in.
  - `pattern`: str - The filename pattern to match (e.g., `*.pdf`).
- **Return Value**: 
  - List[str] - A list of file paths matching the pattern.

## Tool 4: `merge_pdfs_ordered`
- **Function Name**: `merge_pdfs_ordered`
- **Description**: Merges PDF files in a specified order based on a given pattern. Supports exact and fuzzy matching.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file_paths`: List[str] - A list of file paths to the PDF files to be merged.
  - `order`: List[str] - A list defining the order in which the PDF files should be merged.
  - `fuzzy_match`: bool - Whether to allow fuzzy matching of patterns (default: False).
  - `output_path`: str - The path where the merged PDF will be saved.
- **Return Value**: 
  - None. The merged PDF is saved to the specified `output_path`.

## Tool 5: `find_related_pdfs`
- **Function Name**: `find_related_pdfs`
- **Description**: Analyzes the contents of a target PDF file and identifies related PDF files based on filename patterns and content similarity.
- **Parameters**:
  - `target_file`: str - The path to the target PDF file.
  - `directory`: str - The directory to search for related files.
  - `similarity_threshold`: float - A threshold for determining content similarity (default: 0.8).
- **Return Value**: 
  - List[str] - A list of file paths to related PDF files.

# Server Overview

The MCP server is designed to automate PDF file processing tasks. It provides tools to merge, extract, search, and analyze PDF files, as well as identify related files based on content and filename patterns. This server facilitates efficient file management and analysis workflows.

# File to be Generated

The entire implementation will be contained within a single Python file named `pdf_mcp_server.py`.

# Dependencies

The following third-party Python libraries will be required:
- `PyPDF2` - For merging PDFs and extracting pages.
- `glob` - For searching files in directories.
- `fuzzywuzzy` - For fuzzy pattern matching in filenames (optional, based on user request).
- `Levenshtein` - To support fuzzywuzzy for similarity calculations.
- `textdistance` - For advanced content similarity analysis.
- `os` - For directory operations.

# Notes

The tools will leverage asynchronous programming where applicable to ensure efficient performance, especially for operations involving large numbers of files or directory searches.
