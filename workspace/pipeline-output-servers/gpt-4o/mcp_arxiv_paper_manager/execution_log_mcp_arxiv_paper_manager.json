The framework is based on the classical reference framework\\n(axiology, ontology, epistemology, methodology) used for 200 years to define\\nknowledge discovery paradigms and disciplines in the humanities, sciences,\\nalgorithms, and now data science. I augmented it for automated problem-solving\\nwith (methods, technology, community). The resulting data science reference\\nframework is used to define the data science knowledge discovery paradigm in\\nterms of the philosophy of data science addressed in previous papers and the\\ndata science problem-solving paradigm, i.e., the data science method, and the\\ndata science problem-solving workflow, both addressed in this paper. The\\nframework is a much called for unifying framework for data science as it\\ncontains the components required to define data science. For insights to better\\nunderstand data science, this paper uses the framework to define the emerging,\\noften enigmatic, data science problem-solving paradigm and workflow, and to\\ncompare them with their well-understood scientific counterparts, scientific\\nproblem-solving paradigm and workflow.\", \"published\": \"2024-02-14\", \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00776v1\"}, {\"id\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05039v1\", \"title\": \"Defining Data Science\", \"authors\": [\"Yangyong Zhu\", \"Yun Xiong\"], \"summary\": \"Data science is gaining more and more and widespread attention, but no\\nconsensus viewpoint on what data science is has emerged.
