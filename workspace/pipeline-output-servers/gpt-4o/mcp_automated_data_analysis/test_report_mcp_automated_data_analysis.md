## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The main functionalities were partially tested:
- `load_csv` was tested for success and failure cases.
- `run_script` was tested for both valid and invalid usage.
- `explore_data` was tested for both existing and non-existent datasets.

However, due to cascading failures, dependent steps could not be fully validated.

### Identified Issues

1. **Failure to propagate output values between dependent steps**  
   - All dependent steps (`$outputs.load_valid_csv.dataset_name`) failed because the output was not captured or passed correctly.
   - Likely root cause: Output variable resolution mechanism did not work as expected, possibly due to missing implementation or incorrect formatting.

2. **Improper handling of `.zip` files in `load_csv` tool**  
   - The `load_csv` tool attempted to load a `.zip` file without unzipping or validating its format.
   - Expected behavior: Either auto-unzip and load or return a clear error message indicating only CSV files are supported.

3. **Missing input validation for file extensions**  
   - The tool accepted any file path regardless of extension, leading to unexpected errors when the file isn’t a CSV.

### Stateful Operations

Stateful operations relying on previous step outputs failed entirely. No evidence that the system maintains context or passes values between steps, which is essential for workflow continuity.

### Error Handling

- The server generally returned meaningful error messages for direct failures (e.g., file not found).
- However, errors related to unresolved placeholders or missing outputs were ambiguous and did not indicate how to fix the issue.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The server demonstrates basic functionality for loading CSV files and generating profiling reports. However, it fails in key areas like inter-step communication, proper file validation, and script execution context propagation. These issues prevent reliable use in real-world scenarios involving multi-step workflows.

### Recommendations

1. **Fix output value propagation between steps**  
   Ensure that successful tool outputs can be referenced by subsequent steps using `$outputs.<step_id>.<key>` syntax.

2. **Improve file type validation in `load_csv`**  
   Check if the file has a `.csv` extension or attempt to read it and fail gracefully if it’s not a valid CSV.

3. **Enhance error handling for dependent calls**  
   Improve messaging around missing dependencies to guide users/debugging.

4. **Add logging or tracing for step outputs**  
   Include visibility into what outputs are generated per step to aid debugging.

5. **Ensure robust script execution environment**  
   Catch and report syntax errors in `run_script` cleanly, rather than failing silently or propagating nulls.
