# MCP Tools Plan

## Tool: `search_photos`
- **Function Name**: `search_photos`
- **Description**: Searches for photos on the Unsplash platform based on specified parameters such as keywords, pagination, sorting, color, and orientation. Returns a list of photo details including ID, description, image URLs (in multiple sizes), width, and height.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (str): The search keyword for photos (e.g., "nature"). Required.
  - `page` (int): The page number for pagination. Defaults to 1.
  - `per_page` (int): Number of photos to return per page. Defaults to 10.
  - `order_by` (str): Sorting order for results. Possible values: `relevant`, `latest`. Defaults to `relevant`.
  - `color` (str): Filter for photos matching a specific color (e.g., "black_and_white", "blue"). Optional.
  - `orientation` (str): Filter by photo orientation. Possible values: `landscape`, `portrait`, `squarish`. Optional.
- **Return Value**:
  - A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains:
    - `id` (str): Unique identifier for the photo.
    - `description` (str): Description of the photo (if available).
    - `urls` (dict): URLs of the photo in multiple sizes (e.g., `small`, `regular`, `full`).
    - `width` (int): The width of the photo in pixels.
    - `height` (int): The height of the photo in pixels.

# Server Overview

The server will implement an MCP-based architecture to provide an automated image search tool. The tool will interact with the Unsplash API to fetch photo metadata based on user-defined search criteria, such as keywords, pagination, sorting order, color, and orientation. The server will handle API requests, parse responses, and return structured data to clients.

# File to be Generated

The server implementation will be contained in a single Python file:
- **File Name**: `mcp_unsplash_server.py`

# Dependencies

The implementation will require the following third-party Python libraries:
1. **httpx**: For making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Unsplash API.
   - Installation: `pip install httpx`
2. **mcp[cli]**: For implementing the MCP server framework.
   - Installation: `pip install mcp[cli]`
3. **pydantic** (optional): For data validation and structured response modeling (if needed).
   - Installation: `pip install pydantic`
4. **dotenv** (optional): For managing API keys securely via environment variables.
   - Installation: `pip install python-dotenv`

# Implementation Notes

- **Unsplash API Key**: An API key is required to access the Unsplash API. This should be registered and securely stored using environment variables.
- **Endpoint Used**: The server will utilize the `/search/photos` endpoint of the Unsplash API for searching photos and parsing response data.
- **Error Handling**: The server will include robust error handling for invalid parameters, API rate limits, and network issues.
- **Scalability**: The server will be designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently using asynchronous programming with `httpx`.

# Next Steps

1. Register for an Unsplash API developer account and obtain an API key.
2. Implement the `search_photos` tool as described above.
3. Test the server with different search queries to ensure functionality and robustness.
