# mcp_git_repo_manager

## Overview
`mcp_git_repo_manager` is an MCP server that provides a set of tools for managing Git repositories. It allows you to initialize repositories, check status, stage and unstage files, commit changes, view logs, create and switch branches, and inspect commits â€” all via an MCP interface.

This server integrates Git functionality with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling large language models to interact with Git repositories programmatically.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Make sure your `requirements.txt` includes:
```
mcp[cli]
gitpython
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the Python script from the command line:
```bash
python mcp_git_repo_manager.py
```

By default, the server will communicate over standard input/output (`stdio`).
