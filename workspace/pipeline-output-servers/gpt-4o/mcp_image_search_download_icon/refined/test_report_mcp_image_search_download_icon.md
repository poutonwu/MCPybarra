- **Result:** {"status": "fallback", "data": [], "message": "No API key found for pixabay. Please set PIXABAY_API_KEY environment variable for full functionality."}

#### Step: Edge case: Test handling of invalid source input in image search.
- **Tool:** search_images
- **Parameters:** {"keyword": "cars", "source": "invalid_source"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "failure", "error": "Invalid source 'invalid_source'. Must be one of: unsplash, pexels, pixabay"}

- **Parameters:** {"keyword": "flowers", "source": "unsplash"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** {"status": "fallback", "data": [], "message": "No API key found for unsplash. Please set UNSPLASH_API_KEY environment variable for full functionality."}

### Tool: `download_image`

#### Step: Dependent call: Download the first image from the previous Unsplash search result.
- **Tool:** download_image
- **Parameters:** {"image_url": null, "file_name": "nature_image_unsplash.jpg", "directory": "./images"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_images_valid_unsplash.data[0].image_url'

#### Step: Dependent call: Download the first image from the previous Pexels search result.
- **Tool:** download_image
- **Parameters:** {"image_url": null, "file_name": "tech_image_pexels.jpg", "directory": "./images"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_images_valid_pexels.data[0].image_url'

#### Step: Dependent call: Download the first image from the previous Pixabay search result.
- **Tool:** download_image
- **Parameters:** {"image_url": null, "file_name": "animal_image_pixabay.jpg", "directory": "./images"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_images_valid_pixabay.data[0].image_url'

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to download an image with an empty URL.
- **Tool:** download_image
- **Parameters:** {"image_url": "", "file_name": "empty_url_test.jpg", "directory": "./images"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "failure", "error": "No image URL provided. This likely means the previous search step failed."}

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to save an image with an empty file name.
- **Tool:** download_image
- **Parameters:** {"image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg", "file_name": "", "directory": "./images"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "failure", "error": "File name cannot be empty or whitespace only."}

### Tool: `generate_icon`

#### Step: Happy path: Generate an icon with a valid description and size.
- **Tool:** generate_icon
- **Parameters:** {"description": "settings icon", "size": [64, 64], "directory": "./icons"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "success", "file_path": "./icons\\icon_settings_icon.png"}

#### Step: Edge case: Try to generate an icon with negative dimensions.
- **Tool:** generate_icon
- **Parameters:** {"description": "negative size test", "size": [-32, 32], "directory": "./icons"}
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "failure", "error": "Width and height must be positive numbers"}

#### Step: Stress test: Generate a large-sized icon to test resource handling.
- **Tool:** generate_icon

- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** {"status": "success", "file_path": "./icons\\icon_large_icon.png"}

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The main functionalities were partially tested:
- Image search across all three sources was attempted but failed due to missing API keys.
- Icon generation and basic error handling were well-tested.

### Identified Issues

1. **Missing API Keys Prevent Core Functionality**
   - All tests involving `search_images` failed because no API keys were set.
   - Impact: Users will not be able to perform image searches unless API keys are configured.

2. **Failure Propagation Not Handled Gracefully**
   - When `search_images` returned an empty list, dependent `download_image` steps failed with cryptic errors about unresolved placeholders.
   - Impact: Poor user experience; unclear why download fails after a successful-looking search.

3. **Fallback Behavior Lacks Clarity**
   - The server returns `"status": "fallback"` when API keys are missing, but this doesn't clearly communicate that the operation has effectively failed.
   - Impact: Confusion for clients trying to determine if a fallback occurred or if the operation succeeded.

### Stateful Operations

Dependent operations (e.g., download after search) failed when the prior step did not produce usable output. The system does not handle partial failures gracefully.

### Error Handling

Error handling is generally good for direct invalid inputs (e.g., empty filenames, negative sizes). However, it lacks clarity when failures are caused by upstream steps.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's core functionality—image search—is currently non-functional due to missing API keys. While secondary features like icon generation work well, the lack of proper API configuration makes the service unusable for its intended purpose.

### Recommendations

1. **Improve Fallback Messaging**  
   - Clarify that `"status": "fallback"` means the operation did not succeed and requires additional setup.

2. **Add Better Dependency Validation**  
   - Before attempting to download an image, check if the image URL is present and fail early with a clear message if not.

3. **Document Required API Keys Clearly**  
   - Make it more prominent in documentation that API keys are mandatory for full functionality.

4. **Provide Sample API Keys for Testing**  
   - Include dummy keys or mock responses for testing without requiring external accounts.
