- **Parameters:** `{ "keywords": "deep learning", "limit": -1 }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`

### üìÑ Tool: `fetch_paper_details`

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch detailed information about the first paper returned by search_papers using its DOI from Semantic Scholar.
- **Tool:** `fetch_paper_details`
- **Parameters:** `{ "paper_id": null, "source": "Semantic Scholar" }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency."`

#### Step: Edge case: Test server handling of unsupported source input.
- **Tool:** `fetch_paper_details`
- **Parameters:** `{ "paper_id": "10.1145/invalid-doi", "source": "Invalid Source" }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Invalid source specified. Use 'Semantic Scholar' or 'Crossref'."`

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to fetch details for an invalid DOI.
- **Tool:** `fetch_paper_details`
- **Parameters:** `{ "paper_id": "invalid.doi.12345", "source": "Semantic Scholar" }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`

---

### üß† Tool: `search_by_topic`

#### Step: Happy path with filtering: Search for AI-related papers between 2015 and 2020 with a limit of 3 results.
- **Tool:** `search_by_topic`
- **Parameters:** `{ "topic": "artificial intelligence", "year_range": [2015, 2020], "limit": 3 }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`

#### Step: Happy path without year filter: Search for neural network papers with default year range.
- **Tool:** `search_by_topic`
- **Parameters:** `{ "topic": "neural networks", "limit": 4 }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`

#### Step: Edge case: Search for papers in a future year range that likely returns no results.
- **Tool:** `search_by_topic`
- **Parameters:** `{ "topic": "quantum computing", "year_range": [2050, 2060], "limit": 2 }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`

---

### üîÑ Tool: Dependent Calls (via placeholders)

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch details for the first paper in the topic search using Crossref as the source.
- **Tool:** `fetch_paper_details`
- **Parameters:** `{ "paper_id": null, "source": "Crossref" }`
- **Status:** ‚ùå Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency."`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
All three main functionalities (`search_papers`, `fetch_paper_details`, `search_by_topic`) were tested across various scenarios including happy paths, edge cases, and dependent operations.

### Identified Issues

1. **Client Already Closed Before Requests**
   - All tests failed with the error: `"Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed."`
   - This indicates that the `httpx.AsyncClient()` instance is being closed before it's used, likely due to the placement of `asyncio.run(async_client.aclose())` **before** the server starts in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
   - **Impact:** No actual HTTP requests can be made; all tool calls fail silently.

2. **No Input Validation in Some Cases**
   - While negative limit values and empty keywords are handled gracefully in some tools (e.g., `fetch_paper_details` correctly rejects invalid sources), others simply pass them to the API without validation, leading to potential unnecessary requests.

3. **Dependent Call Failures**
   - Since the initial search steps failed, dependent steps relying on placeholder resolution also failed due to missing inputs.
   - **Impact:** Cascading failures across test suite.

### Stateful Operations
The server does not maintain state outside of individual tool calls. However, since placeholder resolution depends on prior successful executions, the cascading failures prevented testing of inter-step dependencies.

### Error Handling
- **Positive:** The server correctly validates source input in `fetch_paper_details` and returns a clear message.
- **Negative:** Most errors stem from internal misconfiguration (closed client), which should be caught at startup rather than during runtime.
- **Improvement Needed:** Better early validation of configuration and initialization steps.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The server's core functionality was never reached due to premature closure of the HTTP client. As a result, **all tests failed**, and no meaningful interaction with external APIs occurred.

### Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ **Fix Client Initialization Order**
   - Move `asyncio.run(async_client.aclose())` after `mcp.run()` to ensure the client remains open during operation.

2. ‚úÖ **Add Early Configuration Validation**
   - Validate that the proxy environment variables and async client are properly configured before starting the server loop.

3. ‚úÖ **Improve Logging**
   - Add debug logs during initialization to catch misconfigurations earlier.

4. ‚úÖ **Input Validation**
   - Enhance validation for parameters like `keywords` and `limit` to prevent sending invalid queries to upstream services.

5. ‚úÖ **Error Recovery Strategy**
   - Implement retry logic or better fallbacks for failed requests, especially for dependent calls.
