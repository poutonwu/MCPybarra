**Parameters:** {"keywords": "deep learning", "limit": -2}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected)  
**Result:** "Limit must be a positive integer" – Expected validation error occurred

---

### ❌ Tool: search_by_topic - No Topic

**Step:** Test server behavior when topic is empty  
**Tool:** search_by_topic  
**Parameters:** {"topic": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected)  
**Result:** "Topic cannot be empty" – Expected validation error occurred

---

### ❌ Tool: search_by_topic - Invalid Year Range

**Step:** Test server behavior when year range is invalid (start > end)  
**Tool:** search_by_topic  
**Parameters:** {"topic": "neural networks", "year_range": [2025, 2020]}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected)  
**Result:** "Invalid year range format. Use (start_year, end_year)" – Expected validation error occurred

---

### ❌ Tool: fetch_paper_details - Invalid Source

**Step:** Test server behavior when an unsupported source is specified  
**Tool:** fetch_paper_details  
**Parameters:** {"paper_id": "10.1145/3368089.3417052", "source": "Invalid Source"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure (Expected)  
**Result:** "Invalid source specified. Use 'Semantic Scholar' or 'Crossref'." – Expected validation error occurred

---

### ❌ Tool: fetch_paper_details - Non-Existent DOI

**Step:** Test server behavior when a non-existent DOI is used  
**Tool:** fetch_paper_details  
**Parameters:** {"paper_id": "10.1145/nonexistent.doi", "source": "Semantic Scholar"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** HTTP 404 Not Found error from Semantic Scholar API

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan covered all main functionalities:
- Basic paper search (`search_papers`)
- Topic-based search with filters (`search_by_topic`)
- Detailed paper information retrieval (`fetch_paper_details`)

### Identified Issues

1. **Missing Data in Search Results**  
   In successful `search_papers` calls, author names, years, and DOIs were consistently empty despite titles being present. This suggests either an issue with the API response parsing or limitations in the Semantic Scholar API.

2. **API Rate Limiting**  
   The `search_by_topic` call failed with a 429 Too Many Requests error, indicating potential issues with handling API rate limits from external services.

3. **Dependent Step Failures**  
   When a prior step fails (e.g., `search_by_topic`), subsequent dependent steps that rely on output values inevitably fail because they receive null parameters.

4. **Error Handling for External Services**  
   The server doesn't implement retry logic or graceful degradation when external APIs (like Semantic Scholar) return errors.

### Stateful Operations

The server correctly implemented dependent operations where one tool's output feeds into another. However, these dependencies failed when the initial step didn't produce valid output.

### Error Handling

The server demonstrated strong input validation:
- Properly rejects empty keywords/topics
- Validates numeric limits
- Checks year range formatting
- Verifies supported data sources

However, it lacks robust handling of external API failures beyond simply propagating the error.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The Academic Paper MCP server demonstrates solid core functionality and input validation but shows fragility when dealing with external API limitations and failures. While the basic search and retrieval capabilities work, several improvements would enhance reliability:

### Recommendations

1. **Improve External API Error Handling**  
   Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs and better error recovery mechanisms.

2. **Enhance Data Extraction from API Responses**  
   Investigate why author/year/DOI fields are frequently empty in search results and ensure complete data extraction.

3. **Add Graceful Degradation for Failed Dependencies**  
   Consider implementing fallback behaviors when dependent steps fail rather than propagating null values.

4. **Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern**  
   Temporarily disable failing external sources rather than continuing to send requests that will fail.

5. **Improve Documentation of Empty Fields**  
   Clarify whether empty author/year/DOI fields are expected behavior or if this indicates a bug.

6. **Add Rate Limit Awareness**  
   Track usage metrics and provide more informative messages when approaching rate limits.
