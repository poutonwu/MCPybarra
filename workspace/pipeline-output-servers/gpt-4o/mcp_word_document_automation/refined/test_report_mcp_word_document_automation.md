## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan covered all major functionalities provided by the server:
- Document creation and opening
- Saving and copying
- Content addition (headings, paragraphs, tables, page breaks)
- Error handling for edge cases

However, some boundary conditions were not fully tested (e.g., minimum/maximum text lengths, extreme heading levels, etc.).

### Identified Issues

1. **add_paragraph_without_document**
   - **Problematic Tool:** add_paragraph
   - **Test Step:** Attempt to add a paragraph without any document being open
   - **Expected Behavior:** Return an error like "No document is currently opened"
   - **Actual Behavior:** Paragraph was added successfully despite no document being open

2. **save_document_without_open**
   - **Problematic Tool:** save_document
   - **Test Step:** Attempt to save without opening or creating a document
   - **Expected Behavior:** Return an error like "No document is currently opened"
   - **Actual Behavior:** Document saved successfully, implying that a new document was silently created

3. **add_table_negative_dimensions**
   - **Problematic Tool:** add_table
   - **Test Step:** Try to create a table with negative rows and columns
   - **Expected Behavior:** Return an error like "Rows and columns must be positive integers"
   - **Actual Behavior:** Table was added successfully, indicating lack of input validation

### Stateful Operations

The server correctly handled dependent operations:
- Document state was preserved across multiple actions
- File paths were passed between steps as expected
- Actions performed on one document did not affect others

### Error Handling

Error messages were generally clear and informative:
- Opening a non-existent file returned a meaningful message
- Invalid heading levels were caught and reported

However, several edge cases failed to trigger appropriate errors:
- Adding content when no document is open
- Creating a table with negative dimensions
- Saving without having a document open

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The `mcp_word_document_automation` server demonstrates solid core functionality and state management. Most tools behave as expected and maintain proper context. However, there are notable issues with input validation and error handling for invalid states.

### Recommendations

1. **Add Input Validation**  
   - Validate that rows and columns are positive integers before attempting to create a table
   - Ensure heading levels are within valid range (0–9)

2. **Improve Error Handling for Stateless Operations**  
   - Prevent adding content or saving when no document is open by returning explicit error messages

3. **Enhance Documentation**  
   - Clarify expected behavior for edge cases in tool descriptions

4. **Expand Test Coverage**  
   - Include tests for more boundary conditions (e.g., max/min values, empty strings, very large inputs)
