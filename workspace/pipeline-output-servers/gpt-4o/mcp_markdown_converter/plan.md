# Implementation Plan for MCP Markdown Conversion Server

## MCP Tools Plan

### Tool 1: `convert_to_markdown`
**Description**: Converts various content formats (HTTP/HTTPS webpages, local files, and data URIs) into structured Markdown format. The tool ensures that structural elements such as headings, lists, links, and tables are preserved.

- **Function Name**: `convert_to_markdown`
- **Parameters**:
  - `source`: 
    - **Type**: `str`
    - **Description**: The source to convert to Markdown. This can be a URL (HTTP or HTTPS), a local file path, or a data URI.
  - `source_type`: 
    - **Type**: `str`
    - **Description**: Specifies the type of the source (`"url"`, `"file"`, or `"data_uri"`).
- **Return Value**:
  - **Type**: `str`
  - **Description**: A string containing the Markdown representation of the input content. This will retain structural elements like headings, lists, links, and tables.

## Server Overview

The server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to convert various formats of content into structured Markdown. It leverages the `markitdown` library to ensure accurate and efficient conversion while preserving the original content's structure. The server supports multiple input formats, including HTTP/HTTPS webpages, local files, and data URIs. Users can access the server via multiple protocols, such as `stdio`, `sse`, and `http`, as supported by the MCP framework.

## File to be Generated

- **Filename**: `mcp_markdown_server.py`
- All server logic, including the MCP tools and dependencies, will be self-contained in this file.

---

## Dependencies

1. **markitdown**: For converting various document formats into Markdown.
   - Installation: `pip install markitdown`
   - Documentation: [markitdown on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)

2. **httpx**: For handling HTTP/HTTPS requests to fetch webpage content.
   - Installation: `pip install httpx`

3. **base64** (Python Standard Library): For decoding data URIs.

4. **mcp**: For implementing the MCP server.
   - Installation: `pip install mcp[cli]`

5. **asyncio**: For asynchronous operations (Python Standard Library).

## Additional Notes

- The `markitdown` library will be used as the core utility for Markdown conversion.
- The `httpx` library will be used for fetching content from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
- The implementation will include proper error handling to manage invalid inputs, inaccessible URLs, or unsupported file formats.
- The server will be designed to run with multiple transport protocols (`stdio`, `sse`, `http`) as per MCP's capabilities.
