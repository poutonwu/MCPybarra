# Server Overview

The MCP server is designed to automate the management of resources from Hugging Face Hub and arXiv. It provides structured tools to search and retrieve information about models, datasets, Spaces, papers, and collections. The server integrates seamlessly with the MCP protocol to offer efficient JSON-RPC-based interactions for external clients.

---

# File to be Generated

The server implementation will be contained within a single Python file named `mcp_hf_arxiv_server.py`.

---

# Dependencies

1. **`huggingface_hub`**: For interacting with Hugging Face Hub's API to search and retrieve models, datasets, Spaces, and collections.
2. **`arxiv.py`**: A Python wrapper for the arXiv API to fetch paper details and daily paper lists.
3. **`mcp[cli]`**: For MCP server functionality.
4. **`httpx`**: For making HTTP requests, particularly for asynchronous API calls.
5. **`asyncio`**: For managing asynchronous operations within the tools.
