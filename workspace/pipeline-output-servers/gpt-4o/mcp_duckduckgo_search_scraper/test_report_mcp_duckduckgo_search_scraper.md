# Test Report for `mcp_duckduckgo_search_scraper`

---

## 1. Test Summary

- **Server:** `mcp_duckduckgo_search_scraper`
- **Objective:** The server provides two tools:
  - `DuckDuckGo_search`: To perform searches on DuckDuckGo and return structured results.
  - `fetch_content`: To extract textual content from a given URL.
  
  These tools are intended to support information retrieval workflows in an automated or semi-automated environment.

- **Overall Result:** Critical failures identified
- **Key Statistics:**
  - Total Tests Executed: 8
  - Successful Tests: 0
  - Failed Tests: 8

All tests failed due to either rate-limiting errors or input validation issues, indicating potential instability or environmental constraints affecting the test outcomes.

## 2. Test Environment

- **Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution
- **MCP Server Tools:**
  - `DuckDuckGo_search`
  - `fetch_content`

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `DuckDuckGo_search`

#### Step: Happy path: Search DuckDuckGo with a valid query to retrieve relevant results.
- **Tool:** DuckDuckGo_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "AI trends in 2025"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit"`

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when an empty query is provided.
- **Tool:** DuckDuckGo_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Query string cannot be empty."`

---

#### Step: Edge case: Test search with non-meaningful or special characters.
- **Tool:** DuckDuckGo_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:\"<>?`~"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/ 202 Ratelimit"`

---

#### Step: Happy path: Search for content within a specific domain to test targeted queries.
- **Tool:** DuckDuckGo_search
- **Parameters:** {"query": "site:wikipedia.org quantum computing"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "https://html.duckduckgo.com/html 202 Ratelimit"`

---

### Tool: `fetch_content`

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch the content of the first result from the previous search.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** {"url": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_valid_query[0].url'"`

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to fetch content from an invalid or unreachable URL.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** {"url": "http://invalid-url-for-testing.com"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "Request failed: 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: http://invalid-url-for-testing.com/"`

---

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to fetch content using an empty URL.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** {"url": ""}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"error": "URL cannot be empty."`

---

#### Step: Dependent call: Fetch content from the first Wikipedia result.
- **Tool:** fetch_content
- **Parameters:** {"url": null}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** `"A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.search_specific_website[0].url'"`

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test plan covered both primary functions (`DuckDuckGo_search`, `fetch_content`) across happy paths and edge cases. However, all attempts to invoke external services resulted in failures, limiting functional validation.

### Identified Issues
1. **Rate Limiting Errors**  
   All calls to DuckDuckGo endpoints returned `202 Ratelimit`. This suggests either excessive request volume during testing or lack of proper authentication/headers for bypassing rate limits.

2. **Missing Input Validation for Empty Query**  
   While the tool correctly raised an error for an empty query, this was expected behavior. Still, it confirms that the function works as designed for edge cases.

3. **Failure in Dependent Steps Due to Missing Output Resolution**  
   Because prior steps failed (due to rate limiting), dependent steps relying on outputs (like URLs) could not proceed, resulting in cascading failures.

4. **Fetch Content Fails Gracefully for Invalid URLs**  
   The `fetch_content` tool handled invalid URLs by returning appropriate HTTP error messages, indicating robust error handling.

### Stateful Operations
No stateful operations were tested since the tools are stateless. However, output chaining between steps failed because the prerequisite step did not yield usable data.

### Error Handling
Error handling is generally robust:
- Empty inputs raise clear exceptions.
- Network errors are caught and returned as JSON.
- Dependency failures are logged clearly.

However, the inability to mitigate rate limiting suggests missing retry logic or proxy configuration handling.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's tools are implemented with good error handling and validation logic. However, the inability to successfully execute any real-world query due to rate limiting indicates a critical operational issue.

### Recommendations:
- Implement proxy or authenticated access to DuckDuckGo if available.
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for API requests.
- Enhance documentation to clarify usage limitations.
- Improve test setup to avoid triggering rate limits (e.g., use mocks or sandboxed environments).
