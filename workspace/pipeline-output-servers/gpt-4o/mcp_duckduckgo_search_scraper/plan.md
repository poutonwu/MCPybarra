# MCP Server Implementation Plan: DuckDuckGo Search and Webpage Content Scraping

## MCP Tools Plan

### Tool 1: `DuckDuckGo_search`
- **Function Name**: `DuckDuckGo_search`
- **Description**: Fetches search results from DuckDuckGo based on a user-provided query string. The results are returned in a structured and easily understandable format.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (type: `str`): The search query string provided by the user.
- **Return Value**:
  - `list[dict]`: A list of structured search results, where each result contains:
    - `title` (str): The title of the search result.
    - `url` (str): The URL of the search result.
    - `snippet` (str): A brief snippet or summary of the result.

### Tool 2: `fetch_content`
- **Function Name**: `fetch_content`
- **Description**: Extracts the main textual content from a webpage given its URL. Irrelevant elements like advertisements and navigation links are removed, returning only the essential content.
- **Parameters**:
  - `url` (type: `str`): The URL of the webpage to scrape.
- **Return Value**:
  - `str`: The main textual content of the webpage, stripped of irrelevant elements.

## Server Overview

The server is an MCP implementation designed to automate information retrieval and webpage content processing. It exposes two tools:
1. `DuckDuckGo_search` for retrieving structured search results from the DuckDuckGo search engine.
2. `fetch_content` for scraping and returning the main text content of a webpage.

This server serves as a utility for integrating search and scraping functionalities with external systems via the MCP protocol.

## File to be Generated

The implementation will reside in a single Python file:
- **Filename**: `mcp_duckduckgo_scraper.py`

---

## Dependencies

The following third-party libraries are required:
1. **duckduckgo-search-api**:
   - Purpose: To interact with the DuckDuckGo API for retrieving search results.
   - Installation: `pip install duckduckgo-search-api`
   - Reference: [DuckDuckGo Search API PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search-api/)
   
2. **BeautifulSoup** (from `bs4`):
   - Purpose: To parse and extract meaningful content from HTML documents.
   - Installation: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
   - Reference: [Beautiful Soup Web Scraping Tutorial](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/)

3. **Requests**:
   - Purpose: To fetch webpage content for scraping.
   - Installation: `pip install requests`
   - Reference: [Python Web Scraping Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-web-scraping-tutorial/)

This implementation plan adheres strictly to the user's requirements, ensuring robust and efficient functionality for both DuckDuckGo search and webpage content scraping within the MCP framework.
