## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

- Most core functionalities were tested:
  - Listing folders ✅
  - Searching emails ❌
  - Reading individual emails ❌
  - Replying to emails ❌
  - Composing emails ✅

However, several key functions failed due to inability to locate the "Inbox" folder.

### Identified Issues

1. **Folder Access Issue**
   - Multiple tests failed because the server could not find the "Inbox" folder even though it was listed in the initial step.
   - This suggests either incorrect folder resolution logic or potential case sensitivity mismatch (e.g., “INBOX” vs “Inbox”).

2. **Stateful Operation Handling**
   - The `get_email_by_number` tool failed because no emails were cached after `list_recent_emails` failed.
   - This shows that the server does not handle stateful dependencies gracefully when earlier steps fail.

3. **Input Validation for Recipients**
   - The `compose_email` tool allowed sending an email with an empty recipient list, which caused a native Outlook exception.
   - This indicates missing input validation on required fields like `recipients`.

4. **Date Range Validation**
   - The `search_emails` tool did not validate that `start_date` was before `end_date`, leading to unclear failure reasons.

### Error Handling

- Input validation errors were handled well (e.g., empty folder name, invalid email index).
- However, system-level failures (like folder not found or Outlook COM exceptions) returned vague or unhelpful error messages.

---

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server demonstrates solid core functionality but suffers from critical issues in folder access and error propagation between dependent tools.

### Recommendations:

1. **Fix Folder Resolution Logic**
   - Ensure that folder names are matched case-insensitively.
   - Add logging or debugging output to clarify why a folder wasn't found.

2. **Improve State Management**
   - Avoid failing silently when accessing cached emails that don’t exist.
   - Provide clearer error messaging if `list_recent_emails` didn’t execute successfully before calling `get_email_by_number`.

3. **Enhance Input Validation**
   - Validate that `recipients` is non-empty in `compose_email`.
   - Check that `start_date` is before `end_date` in `search_emails`.

4. **Improve Error Messaging**
   - Return more actionable error messages for system-level failures (e.g., COM interaction errors).
