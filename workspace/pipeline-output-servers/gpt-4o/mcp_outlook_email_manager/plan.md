## Server Overview

The MCP server is designed to automate the management of local Outlook email using the win32com library. It provides tools for listing folders, retrieving recent emails, searching emails, fetching detailed email content, replying to emails, and composing new emails. These functionalities enable efficient and automated email handling directly via JSON-RPC 2.0.

---

## File to be Generated

The implementation will be contained within a single Python file named `outlook_mcp_server.py`.

---

## Dependencies

- `mcp[cli]`: For MCP server implementation.
- `pywin32`: For interacting with Outlook via the win32com library.
- `httpx`: Optional dependency for making external HTTP requests if needed.
- `pytz`: Optional dependency for handling timezone-aware datetime operations.
