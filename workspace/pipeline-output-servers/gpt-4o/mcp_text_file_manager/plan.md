# Implementation Plan for MCP Server

## MCP Tools Plan

### 1. **Function Name**: `get_text_file_contents`
   - **Description**: Reads the content of a text file, optionally within a specified line range, and returns the file's hash for concurrency control.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path to the text file.
     - `start_line` (int, optional): The starting line number (inclusive) for the range to read. Defaults to the beginning of the file.
     - `end_line` (int, optional): The ending line number (inclusive) for the range to read. Defaults to the end of the file.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A dictionary with:
       - `content` (str): The content read from the file in the specified range.
       - `hash` (str): The SHA256 hash of the file for concurrency control.

---

### 2. **Function Name**: `create_text_file`
   - **Description**: Creates a new text file and writes the provided content to it.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path where the new file should be created.
     - `content` (str): The content to write to the new file.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A success message indicating the file was created.

---

### 3. **Function Name**: `append_text_file_contents`
   - **Description**: Appends content to an existing text file.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path to the existing text file.
     - `content` (str): The content to append to the file.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A success message confirming the content was appended.

---

### 4. **Function Name**: `delete_text_file_contents`
   - **Description**: Deletes content within a specified line range in a text file.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path to the text file.
     - `start_line` (int): The starting line number (inclusive) of the range to delete.
     - `end_line` (int): The ending line number (inclusive) of the range to delete.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A success message confirming the specified lines were deleted.

---

### 5. **Function Name**: `insert_text_file_contents`
   - **Description**: Inserts content at a specified position in a text file.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path to the text file.
     - `line_number` (int): The line number before which the content will be inserted.
     - `content` (str): The content to insert into the file.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A success message confirming the content was inserted.

---

### 6. **Function Name**: `patch_text_file_contents`
   - **Description**: Applies precise edits to a text file based on provided changes. Validates the file hash to avoid concurrency conflicts.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `file_path` (str): Path to the text file.
     - `patch_data` (list of dict): A list of changes, where each change specifies:
       - `start_line` (int): Start line for the patch.
       - `end_line` (int): End line for the patch.
       - `new_content` (str): New content to replace the specified range.
     - `expected_hash` (str): Expected SHA256 hash of the file to confirm no concurrent modifications.
   - **Return Value**:
     - A success message if the patch is applied successfully.
     - An error message if the hash does not match.

## Server Overview

The MCP server is designed to automate text file management tasks. It provides functionalities such as reading file contents with concurrency control, creating new files, appending content, deleting specific ranges, inserting content at specific positions, and applying precise patches with hash validation.

## File to be Generated

- **File Name**: `mcp_text_file_server.py`

All code, including the MCP server and tool implementations, will reside in this single Python file.

## Dependencies

- **mcp[cli]**: For creating and running the MCP server.
- **httpx**: For any additional asynchronous operations (if needed in the future).
- **hashlib**: For generating file hashes to ensure concurrency control.
- **itertools**: For reading specific line ranges in files efficiently.
