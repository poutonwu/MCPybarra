### Partial Reading and Appending

**Step:** Happy path: Read a specific line range from the file to test partial reading functionality.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "start_line": 2, "end_line": 4}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Happy path: Append new content to the end of the file and prepare for future read/patch operations.  
**Tool:** append_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "content": "\nAppended Line"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Dependent call: Verify that appending worked by reading the full file again.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

### Insertion and Deletion

**Step:** Happy path: Insert content at a specific position and prepare for patching or deletion.  
**Tool:** insert_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "line_number": 3, "content": "Inserted Line"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Dependent call: Verify that insertion worked by reading the full file again.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Happy path: Delete a range of lines to test deletion logic and prepare for concurrency testing.  
**Tool:** delete_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "start_line": 2, "end_line": 4}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Dependent call: Confirm deletion was successful by reading the updated file.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

### Patching and Concurrency Control

**Step:** Prepare hash for patch operation by reading current file hash.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Happy path: Apply a patch using correct hash to ensure concurrent edit detection works properly.  
**Tool:** patch_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "patch_data": [{"start_line": 2, "end_line": 3, "new_content": "Patched Content"}], "expected_hash": null}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.get_hash_for_patch.hash'

**Step:** Dependent call: Verify patch was applied correctly by reading the final content.  
**Tool:** get_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/nonexistent_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to delete out-of-range lines to test boundary condition handling.  
**Tool:** delete_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "start_line": 999, "end_line": 1000}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to insert at a line number beyond file length to test robustness.  
**Tool:** insert_text_file_contents  
**Parameters:** {"file_path": "$temp_dir/test_file.txt", "line_number": 999, "content": "Out of bounds Insert"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** {"error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '$temp_dir/test_file.txt'"}

## 4. Analysis and Findings

**Functionality Coverage:**  
The test plan comprehensively covers all core functionalities of the file management system, including creation, reading (full and partial), appending, insertion, deletion, patching, and concurrency control.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Missing Temp Directory:** All tests failed because the `$temp_dir` placeholder wasn't substituted with an actual working directory path.
2. **Placeholder Resolution:** The test framework didn't handle dependencies between steps correctly (e.g., trying to use a hash from a previous step that never executed).
3. **Error Propagation:** Failures cascaded through dependent steps, making it impossible to validate later operations.

**Stateful Operations:**  
Although the test plan included stateful operations (like using a hash from a previous read to patch), these couldn't be evaluated because no initial operations succeeded.

**Error Handling:**  
When attempting direct invalid operations (like reading a non-existent file), the server returned clear error messages. However, this was only tested in isolation as most errors were environmental rather than functional.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

All tests failed due to a fundamental issue with the test environment configuration, specifically around the unimplemented `$temp_dir` placeholder and dependency resolution between test steps. While we cannot confirm the correctness of the implementation based on these results, the test plan itself appears comprehensive and well-structured.

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement proper test directory setup to resolve `$temp_dir` before running tests
2. Ensure proper handling of placeholder substitution between dependent test steps
3. Add pre-flight checks to verify directory structure before executing test steps
4. Consider adding tool validation routines to check if required directories exist
5. Improve test runner to better handle and report placeholder resolution issues
