# Advanced File Search Server Test Report

## 1. Test Summary

- **Server:** `advanced_file_search`
- **Objective:** Provide file search and metadata retrieval capabilities using the Everything64.dll library on Windows systems.

- **Key Statistics:**
    - Total Tests Executed: 11
    - Successful Tests: 11
    - Failed Tests: 0

## 2. Test Environment

- **Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution
- **MCP Server Tools:**
    - `search_files`
    - `get_file_details`

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: `search_files`

#### Step: Happy path: Search for all .txt files with default parameters.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "*.txt"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Found 1 `.txt` file matching the query.

#### Step: Test case-sensitive search to ensure it respects uppercase/lowercase distinctions.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "example", "case_sensitive": true}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully returned expected file.

#### Step: Test regex-based search pattern to match .txt files explicitly using a regular expression.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "^.*\\.txt$", "regex": true}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Regex successfully matched expected file.

#### Step: Edge case: Test server behavior when query is an empty string.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": ""}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Returned file despite empty query (behavior may be questionable).

#### Step: Edge case: Test handling of potentially invalid or dangerous characters in the query.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "*<>?|"}`  
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Handled special characters without error.

#### Step: Test sorting functionality by searching PDF files and sorting them by size.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "*.pdf", "sort_by": "size"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Searched and sorted as requested.

#### Step: Test search for a known specific file available in the test environment.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "执行结果文本.txt"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully found the specified file.

### Tool: `get_file_details`

#### Step: Dependent call: Retrieve detailed information about the first file from search results.
- **Tool:** `get_file_details`
- **Parameters:** `{"file_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\example.txt"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Retrieved full details for the file.

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt to retrieve details for a file that does not exist.
- **Tool:** `get_file_details`
- **Parameters:** `{"file_path": "C:\\Invalid\\Path\\NonExistentFile.txt"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success *(semantically incorrect)*
- **Result:** Unexpected success; should have failed due to nonexistent file.

#### Step: Use absolute path of a known file to get its details directly, bypassing prior steps.
- **Tool:** `get_file_details`
- **Parameters:** `{"file_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\执行结果文本.txt"}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Successfully retrieved file details.

### Miscellaneous

#### Step: Test that the limit parameter restricts the number of returned results correctly.
- **Tool:** `search_files`
- **Parameters:** `{"query": "*.pdf", "limit": 5}`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Result:** Limit applied successfully.

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage:
All core functionalities were tested:
- Basic file search (`*.txt`, etc.)
- Case sensitivity
- Regular expressions
- Sorting
- Limiting results
- Special character handling
- Empty queries
- File detail retrieval

### Identified Issues:
1. **Unexpected Success in Invalid File Path Lookup**  
   - The `get_file_details` tool did not fail when given a clearly invalid file path.
   - This suggests poor input validation or improper integration with the DLL.

2. **Empty Query Handling**  
   - The `search_files` tool returned results even when the query was an empty string.
   - Behavior should be clarified—should this return all files or raise an error?

3. **Special Characters Not Escaped or Rejected**  
   - Though handled gracefully, some characters like `<`, `>`, `|` might cause issues in real usage if not properly escaped.

### Stateful Operations:
The dependent step (`get_file_details`) used output from a previous `search_files` result correctly, indicating that variable substitution and chaining work as intended.

### Error Handling:
- Most tools returned mock success responses regardless of input validity.
- There were no actual errors thrown in any test step, even when expected.
- Real-world error scenarios (e.g., missing file, invalid permissions) were not adequately represented.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion:
The server appears stable under basic testing conditions and supports all intended operations. However, deeper integration with `everything.dll` needs verification, as current behavior seems overly optimistic.

### Recommendations:
- Improve error handling to reflect real-world failures.
- Add input validation for paths and queries.
- Clarify expected behavior for edge cases like empty queries and special characters.
- Implement better logging and debugging mechanisms for development support.
