# MCP MySQL DB Manager Test Report

## 1. Test Summary

**Server:** mcp_mysql_db_manager  
**Objective:** The server provides a set of tools to interact with a MySQL database, including listing tables, reading table data, and executing custom SQL queries. It is designed to handle connection retries and provide appropriate error handling for invalid inputs or failed operations.

**Overall Result:** Critical failures identified

**Key Statistics:**
- Total Tests Executed: 11
- Successful Tests: 0
- Failed Tests: 11

## 2. Test Environment

**Execution Mode:** Automated plan-based execution  
**MCP Server Tools:**
- list_resources
- read_resource
- execute_sql

## 3. Detailed Test Results

### Tool: list_resources

**Step:** Happy path: List all tables in the connected database. This assumes a successful connection and existing tables.  
**Tool:** list_resources  
**Parameters:** {}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to list tables: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

---

### Tool: read_resource

**Step:** Dependent call (list access): Read data from the first table returned by list_tables. Uses `[0]` to get the first table name.  
**Tool:** read_resource  
**Parameters:** {"table_name": null}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.list_tables[0]'"

**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to read a resource with an empty table name, expecting a ValueError.  
**Tool:** read_resource  
**Parameters:** {"table_name": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Error executing tool read_resource: Invalid table_name. It must be a non-empty string."

**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to read a resource with a numeric table name, expecting a ValueError.  
**Tool:** read_resource  
**Parameters:** {"table_name": 123}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to read table 123: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

---

### Tool: execute_sql

**Step:** Dependent call (key access): Execute a SELECT query on the same table as read_first_table, fetching one row.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "SELECT * FROM `$outputs.read_first_table.table_name` LIMIT 1"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

**Step:** Happy path: Execute a SHOW TABLES query directly using execute_sql tool.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "SHOW TABLES"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

**Step:** Edge case: Test execution of an invalid SQL query that references a non-existent table.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "SELECT * FROM non_existent_table"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

**Step:** Edge case: Attempt to execute an empty SQL query, expecting a ValueError.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": ""}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Error executing tool execute_sql: Invalid query. It must be a non-empty string."

**Step:** Happy path: Create a temporary table and insert a record using execute_sql tool.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE test_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100)); INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (1, 'Test')"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

**Step:** Dependent call: Delete the previously inserted test record from the temporary table.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "DELETE FROM test_table WHERE id = 1"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

**Step:** Dependent call: Drop the temporary table created earlier.  
**Tool:** execute_sql  
**Parameters:** {"query": "DROP TABLE test_table"}  
**Status:** ❌ Failure  
**Result:** "Failed to execute query: Error connecting to MySQL after 3 attempts: 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (10061)"

## 4. Analysis and Findings

**Functionality Coverage:**  
The test plan covered all three available tools (`list_resources`, `read_resource`, `execute_sql`) and tested both happy paths and edge cases. However, due to connection failures, the core functionality could not be fully validated.

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Persistent Connection Failure**: All tests failed due to inability to connect to the MySQL server. This indicates either a configuration issue, missing environment variables, or lack of running MySQL service.
2. **Incomplete Parameter Validation**: While some validation exists (e.g., empty strings), type validation appears inconsistent (numeric table names should raise ValueError but instead triggered connection errors).
3. **Error Message Clarity**: In some cases, more specific error messages would help distinguish between connection issues and input validation failures.

**Stateful Operations:**  
Dependent operations failed because prior steps did not succeed. The framework correctly handled dependencies by not attempting to use undefined outputs, but this also meant no dependent operations could be validated.

**Error Handling:**  
The server generally provided clear error messages when it could identify issues (like empty strings). However, in several cases, the connection failure overshadowed potential input validation errors, making diagnosis less straightforward.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The server's core functionality could not be validated due to persistent connection failures to the MySQL database. This suggests either environmental misconfiguration or missing runtime dependencies.

**Recommendations:**
1. Ensure the MySQL server is running and accessible at localhost:3306
2. Verify that all required environment variables (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE) are properly set
3. Improve input validation consistency - numeric values for table names should trigger ValueErrors before attempting database connection
4. Consider separating connection errors from query execution errors in logs for better diagnostics
5. Add explicit checks for database connection status before executing queries to fail fast with clearer error messages
