# Implementation Plan for MCP Server: MySQL Automation

## MCP Tools Plan

### Tool 1: `list_resources`
- **Description**: Lists all available MySQL tables in the connected database.
- **Parameters**:
  - None.
- **Return Value**:
  - A list of table names as strings.

### Tool 2: `read_resource`
- **Description**: Reads the entire content of a specified MySQL table and returns the first 100 rows in a structured format.
- **Parameters**:
  - `table_name` (str): The name of the table to read data from.
- **Return Value**:
  - A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the table. The keys are column names, and the values are the corresponding data.

### Tool 3: `execute_sql`
- **Description**: Executes a custom SQL query on the connected MySQL database. Supports SELECT, SHOW, INSERT, UPDATE, and other SQL operations.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (str): The SQL query to execute.
- **Return Value**:
  - For SELECT or SHOW queries: A list of dictionaries representing the result set.
  - For INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other queries: A dictionary with the number of affected rows (e.g., `{"affected_rows": X}`).

## Server Overview
This MCP server automates MySQL database management by providing tools to:
1. List all available tables in the database.
2. Retrieve data from specific tables with row limits.
3. Execute custom SQL queries and return structured results.

The server is designed to streamline database operations for end-users, enabling efficient data management through a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface.

---

## File to be Generated
The server implementation will be contained in a single Python file named:
`mcp_mysql_server.py`

---

## Dependencies
The following third-party Python libraries are required:
1. **`mcp[cli]`**: For building and running the MCP server.
2. **`mysql-connector-python`**: For connecting to the MySQL database and executing SQL queries.

This plan details the tools and structure needed to implement the requested MCP server for MySQL database automation.
