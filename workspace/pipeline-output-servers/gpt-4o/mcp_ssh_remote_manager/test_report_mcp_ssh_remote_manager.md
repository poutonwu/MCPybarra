- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** {"error": "Invalid session ID", "details": "Invalid session ID"}

---

### Tool: `upload`

#### Step: Dependent call: Upload a test file to the remote server.
- **Tool:** upload
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": null, "local_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\执行结果文本.txt", "remote_path": "/tmp/执行结果文本.txt"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** A required parameter resolved to None, likely due to a failure in a dependency. Failed placeholder: '$outputs.connect_ssh.session_id'

#### Step: Edge case: Attempt upload with invalid session and file paths.
- **Tool:** upload
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": "nonexistent_session", "local_path": "invalid/local/path.txt", "remote_path": "/invalid/remote/path.txt"}
- **Status:** ❌ Failure
- **Result:** {"error": "Invalid session ID", "details": "Invalid session ID"}

---

### Tool: `download`

#### Step: Dependent call: Download the previously uploaded file back to local machine.
- **Tool:** download
- **Parameters:** {"session_id": null, "remote_path": "/tmp/执行结果文本.txt", "local_path": "D:\\pbc_course\\MCPServer-Generator\\testSystem\\testFiles\\下载_执行结果文本.txt"}

## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage

The test plan covers all core functionalities provided by the server:
- Connection establishment (`connect`)
- Command execution (`execute`)
- File transfer (`upload`, `download`)
- Session management (`disconnect`, `list_sessions`)

However, most tests failed due to inability to establish a base SSH connection.

### Identified Issues

1. **SSH Connectivity Issue**
   - All `connect` attempts failed except those expected to fail due to invalid parameters.
   - Likely root cause: SSH server is not running locally, or there's a network configuration issue preventing localhost access.

2. **Dependent Steps Fail Due to Missing Session ID**
   - Because `connect` fails, dependent steps like `execute`, `upload`, `download`, and `disconnect` cannot proceed.
   - These are not true functional errors in their respective tools but cascading failures from the initial connection problem.

3. **Error Handling**
   - The server correctly returns structured JSON error messages when invalid session IDs are used.
   - However, some error handling could be improved:
     - For missing credentials, the error message does not clearly indicate that both password and private key were missing.
     - For unreachable hosts, the error message could include more detail about possible causes.

### Stateful Operations

- Since no successful `connect` occurred, stateful operations involving session IDs were not fully tested.
- In cases where invalid session IDs were explicitly used, the server correctly returned `"Invalid session ID"` errors, indicating good validation logic.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

The server implementation appears structurally correct, with proper error handling and JSON formatting. However, **critical failures in establishing SSH connections prevented meaningful testing** of most functionality.

### Recommendations

1. **Ensure SSH Server Availability**
   - Ensure that an SSH server is running during testing.
   - Consider mocking SSH behavior in unit tests to avoid dependency on external services.

2. **Improve Initial Connection Validation**
   - Add pre-flight checks or better error messaging for common connection issues (e.g., SSH service not running).

3. **Enhance Error Messages**
   - Clarify error responses when neither password nor private key is provided.
   - Include more diagnostic information when connection fails (e.g., timeout vs refused vs host not found).

4. **Add Input Validation**
   - Validate that either password or private key is provided before attempting connection.
   - Check that local file paths exist before initiating uploads.
