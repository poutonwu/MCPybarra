## 4. Analysis and Findings

### Functionality Coverage
The test suite attempts to cover all core functionalities:
- Connection establishment (`connect`)
- Session management (`list_sessions`, `disconnect`)
- Remote command execution (`execute`)
- File transfer (`upload`, `download`)

However, most dependent operations failed due to prior failures in establishing a session.

### Identified Issues

1. **SSH Connection Failures**
   - All `connect` tests failed due to inability to reach SSH on `127.0.0.1`.
   - This indicates either:
     - Missing SSH service on localhost
     - Network misconfiguration
     - Incorrect credentials/key paths used in test setup

2. **Session ID Dependency Failures**
   - Any step depending on a session ID from a previous `connect` step failed because no valid session was created.
   - This cascaded errors across the entire test suite.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Input validation errors were handled correctly (empty hostname, missing auth).
   - However, generic SSH exceptions were not well-documented—returned `"Unexpected error"` instead of more specific diagnostics.

### Stateful Operations
Stateful operations like `execute`, `upload`, `download`, and `disconnect` rely on a valid `session_id`. Since no session could be established, these steps could not validate their logic.

### Error Handling
- Input validation was strong:
  - Empty hostname
  - Missing authentication parameters
- However, low-level SSH errors were masked as `"Unexpected error"`, which is unhelpful for debugging.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The server's core functionality was not validated due to repeated failures in establishing an SSH connection. While some edge cases and validations passed, the main use cases (connecting and running commands) failed.

### Recommendations
1. **Improve Low-Level SSH Error Reporting**
   - Replace generic `"Unexpected error"` with actual exception messages.
2. **Validate SSH Service Readiness Before Testing**
   - Ensure SSH is running and accessible before executing tests.
3. **Enhance Dependency Resolution in Test Framework**
   - Gracefully handle skipped dependent steps when prerequisites fail.
4. **Add Timeout Handling for SSH Connection Attempts**
   - Provide clearer feedback if SSH handshake fails due to timeout.
